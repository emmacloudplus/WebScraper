[{"title": "Obama and Trump wade into key battle over Virginia\u2019s governor seat", "author": "Edward Helmore", "date": "October 16, 2021, 3:41 PM", "body": "Photograph: Cliff Owen/APJoe Biden faces a key test of public standing in a tight and closely watched campaign for governor in Virginia next month. So important has the fight now become in being seen as a bellwether for the 2022 midterm elections, that two ex-presidents are weighing in on the battle.For Biden and the Democrats winning Virginia would hold out the prospect of keeping a grip on congress next year and avoiding being seen as a lame duck administration. For Republicans, a win could pre-sage a major comeback in 2022 and a return to electoral strength of a party still dominated by Donald Trump.The stakes are so high that both Trump and Barack Obama are intervening in the race.Related: Why Virginia holds the key to the 2022 US midterms: Politics Weekly Extra podcastLast week, Trump called in to a gathering of Virginia supporters, urging them to vote for the Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin, and calling him \u201ca great gentleman\u201d. Meanwhile, Obama will later this month arrive in the state to boost turnout among Black voters. \u201cThe stakes could not be greater,\u201d Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe said, as he announced Obama\u2019s campaign support on MSNBC last week.The proxies in the contest, McAuliffe, a former governor running for the job he held from 2014-18, and first-time Republican challenger Youngkin, are currently polling relatively closely at 48.5% and 46.4%, according FiveThirtyEight \u2013 making the race unpredictable and tight.The men are running to replace the state\u2019s Democratic governor Ralph Northam who has been in the party\u2019s political doghouse since 2019 when it was revealed his 1984 medical school yearbook page contained a photo of one person dressed as a member of the KKK and another in blackface impersonating an African American.The Virginia race comes against a backdrop of bad news for Biden, who has seen his popularity fall in the aftermath of the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and legislative gridlock on the main plans of his domestic agenda and growing uncertainty of post-pandemic economic recovery. His approval rating has sunk from 55% in March to about 44% now.Story continuesBut so, too, does the contest present a test for Trump, who lost Virginia by 10% in 2020, but is increasingly seen to be gauging his hold on the Republican party and its voters ahead of the midterms, which could then swing his decision to run for re-election in 2024.Nor is Trump\u2019s intervention in the race a win-win for Youngkin. The two men are not likely to campaign in person as Youngkin must simultaneously appeal to pro-Trump rural voters, but not telegraph any association so blatantly that he turns off moderate Republican voters in Virginia\u2019s Washington-centric northern suburbs where elections in the state are often decided.Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in the state, told the Washington Post that if Trump were to hold a rally in the state, it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Youngkin. \u201cThe more he shows up and he more he participates, the worse off it is for Youngkin,\u201d he added.But Trump countered that political wisdom with some of his own: \u201cThe only guys that win are the guys that embrace the Maga movement,\u201d Trump said in an interview with conservative talkshow host John Fredericks.Instead of overtly embracing Trump, Youngkin has campaigned with Texas senator Ted Cruz and with former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. But he steered clear of an event hosted by Trump strategist Steve Bannon who may face contempt charges on Tuesday for refusing to cooperate with an investigation into the 6 January Capitol riot. Youngkin was also careful to criticize the Bannon event\u2019s use of a flag that had reportedly been flown at the 6 January insurrection.Youngkin\u2019s hands-off, hands-on approach is also designed to not raise the hackles of relatively unengaged democratic support for McAuliffe, who has his own endorsement issues to deal with.For his part, Virginia\u2019s former governor comes with the baggage of close ties to the Clintons, whose popularity among independents and left-wing Democrats is far from assured. Last month, Hillary Clinton, whose first, failed presidential nomination campaign was co-chaired by McAuliffe sent out a fundraising email. That was followed by a fundraising event hosted by Bill Clinton.But other Democratic heavy-weights are traveling to Virginia to soothe Democratic anxiety and try to propel McAuliffe\u2019s campaign toward the decisive victory they need. Georgia Democratic star Stacey Abrams and Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and first lady Jill Biden are also expected in the state\u2019s northern suburbs, while House speaker Nancy Pelosi plans a fundraiser.But Biden himself has and will likely remain absent from Virginia. Mirroring Youngkin\u2019s relationship to Trump, McAuliffe and his aides have expressed fears over associating with Biden. McAuliffe recently described the president as \u201cunpopular\u201d in Virginia.McAuliffe has also indicated that legislative impasse in Washington is damaging to Democrats in the country at large. \u201cDemocrats have got to quit talking, and they\u2019ve got to get something done,\u201d McAuliffe told The Washington Post. \u201cYou got elected to get things done. We have the House, Senate and White House.\u201dHanging over Democratic heads are the memories of losing the midterm elections in 2010, a crushing defeat for Obama that was predicted when Democrats lost a Senate seat in Massachusetts while trying to push through a controversial healthcare reform bill.", "preprocessed": "photograph cliff owen apjo biden face key test public stand tight close watch campaign governor virginia next month import fight becom seen bellweth midterm elect two ex presid weigh battl biden democrat win virginia would hold prospect keep grip congress next year avoid seen lame duck administr republican win could pre sage major comeback return elector strength parti still domin donald trump stake high trump barack obama interven race relat virginia hold key u midterm polit weekli extra podcastlast week trump call gather virginia support urg vote republican candid glenn youngkin call great gentleman meanwhil obama later month arriv state boost turnout among black voter stake could greater democrat candid terri mcauliff said announc obama campaign support msnbc last week proxi contest mcauliff former governor run job held first time republican challeng youngkin current poll rel close accord fivethirtyeight make race unpredict tight men run replac state democrat governor ralph northam parti polit doghous sinc reveal medic school yearbook page contain photo one person dress member kkk anoth blackfac imperson african american virginia race come backdrop bad news biden seen popular fall aftermath botch afghanistan withdraw legisl gridlock main plan domest agenda grow uncertainti post pandem econom recoveri approv rate sunk march stori continuesbut contest present test trump lost virginia increasingli seen gaug hold republican parti voter ahead midterm could swing decis run elect trump intervent race win win youngkin two men like campaign person youngkin must simultan appeal pro trump rural voter telegraph associ blatantli turn moder republican voter virginia washington centric northern suburb elect state often decid bob holsworth longtim polit analyst state told washington post trump hold ralli state would disast youngkin show particip wors youngkin ad trump counter polit wisdom guy win guy embrac maga movement trump said interview conserv talkshow host john frederick instead overtli embrac trump youngkin campaign texa senat ted cruz former south carolina governor nikki haley steer clear event host trump strategist steve bannon may face contempt charg tuesday refus cooper investig januari capitol riot youngkin also care critic bannon event use flag reportedli flown januari insurrect youngkin hand hand approach also design rais hackl rel unengag democrat support mcauliff endors issu deal part virginia former governor come baggag close tie clinton whose popular among independ left wing democrat far assur last month hillari clinton whose first fail presidenti nomin campaign co chair mcauliff sent fundrais email follow fundrais event host bill clinton democrat heavi weight travel virginia sooth democrat anxieti tri propel mcauliff campaign toward decis victori need georgia democrat star stacey abram atlanta mayor keisha lanc bottom first ladi jill biden also expect state northern suburb hous speaker nanci pelosi plan fundrais biden like remain absent virginia mirror youngkin relationship trump mcauliff aid express fear associ biden mcauliff recent describ presid unpopular virginia mcauliff also indic legisl impass washington damag democrat countri larg democrat got quit talk got get someth done mcauliff told washington post got elect get thing done hous senat white hous hang democrat head memori lose midterm elect crush defeat obama predict democrat lost senat seat massachusett tri push controversi healthcar reform bill"}, {"title": "Democratic Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema received the maximum donation allowed by law from several GOP donors.Donors previously donated to pro-Trump PACs and a PAC to elect Republicans to the Senate.Sinema, a Democrat, has positioned herself as a key obstacle to President Joe Biden's agenda.Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, received the maximum donation allowed by law by several longtime GOP donors, according to a campaign fundraising report filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission.According to the FEC data, first reported by Mother Jones, Sinema raised $1.1 million between July and September this year, about the same amount she raised in previous fundraising cycles, according to the report, despite growing frustration among Arizona Democrats.Included in the FEC disclosure are several GOP donors who have previously supported efforts to elect former President Donald Trump and to help Republicans get the majority in the Senate. The maximum individual contribution limit is $2,900 per election, with a maximum of $5,800 in a two-year period, according to FEC guidelines.Among those who made the maximum donation was Minnesota billionaire Stan Hubbard, who regularly donates to the RNC and supported Scott Walker and eventually Trump's campaign for president through donations to a super PAC, Mother Jones reported.Jimmy Haslam, the owner of the Cleveland Brown's and Pilot truck stops, and his wife, Susan, individually donated the maximum legal amount to Sinema on September 30, Mother Jones reported, citing the FEC data. According to the report, Haslam has given at least $425,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with Sen. Mitch McConnell that works to elect Republicans in the Senate.Other GOP donors who backed Sinema include Marc Rowan, the CEO of the private equity firm Apollo who backed Trump's failed bid for reelection, and his wife, Carolyn, who individually donated the maximum legal limit. Private equity executive Anthony De Nicola, who also has backed the Senate Leadership Fund, also donated the maximum legal limit to Sinema, according to Mother Jones.Story continuesProgressives and other Democrats have grown frustrated with Sinema, who has made headlines in recent months for her reluctance to support key pieces of President Joe Biden's agenda. Sinema is currently fundraising in Europe, per The New York Times.Both Sinema and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin have been opposed to parts of a Democratic spending plan to invest in climate, education, and healthcare spending. While Manchin has been clear about wanting to cut the price tag of the proposal, it's largely unclear what Sinema would support, as Insider previously reported.Sinema, however, has reportedly been opposed to raising tax rates for individuals and large corporations, said two Senate Democratic aides familiar with the matter. Her position threatens to deprive the package of over $700 billion in revenue to pay for Biden's \"Build Back Better\" agenda.Sinema, a first-term lawmaker, is not up for re-election until 2024.Read the original article on Business Insider", "preprocessed": "sen kyrsten sinema democrat arizona tom william cq roll call inc via getti imagesarizona sen kyrsten sinema receiv maximum donat allow law sever gop donor donor previous donat pro trump pac pac elect republican senat sinema democrat posit key obstacl presid joe biden agenda arizona sen kyrsten sinema democrat receiv maximum donat allow law sever longtim gop donor accord campaign fundrais report file friday feder elect commiss accord fec data first report mother jone sinema rais million juli septemb year amount rais previou fundrais cycl accord report despit grow frustrat among arizona democrat includ fec disclosur sever gop donor previous support effort elect former presid donald trump help republican get major senat maximum individu contribut limit per elect maximum two year period accord fec guidelin among made maximum donat minnesota billionair stan hubbard regularli donat rnc support scott walker eventu trump campaign presid donat super pac mother jone report jimmi haslam owner cleveland brown pilot truck stop wife susan individu donat maximum legal amount sinema septemb mother jone report cite fec data accord report haslam given least senat leadership fund super pac associ sen mitch mcconnel work elect republican senat gop donor back sinema includ marc rowan ceo privat equiti firm apollo back trump fail bid reelect wife carolyn individu donat maximum legal limit privat equiti execut anthoni de nicola also back senat leadership fund also donat maximum legal limit sinema accord mother jone stori continuesprogress democrat grown frustrat sinema made headlin recent month reluct support key piec presid joe biden agenda sinema current fundrais europ per new york time sinema west virginia sen joe manchin oppos part democrat spend plan invest climat educ healthcar spend manchin clear want cut price tag propos larg unclear sinema would support insid previous report sinema howev reportedli oppos rais tax rate individu larg corpor said two senat democrat aid familiar matter posit threaten depriv packag billion revenu pay biden build back better agenda sinema first term lawmak elect read origin articl busi insid"}, {"title": "Money Floods the Race for Control of Congress, More Than a Year Early", "author": "Shane Goldmacher", "date": "October 16, 2021, 11:23 AM", "body": "President Donald Trump fist bumps Herschel Walker, a former NFL player, at an event about Black economic empowerment in Atlanta, Sept. 25, 2020. (Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)A dizzying amount of money is already pouring into the battles for the House and the Senate more than a year before the 2022 elections, as Republicans are bullish on their chances to take over both chambers in the first midterm election under President Joe Biden, given the narrow margins keeping Democrats in power.The two parties\u2019 main war chests for the House total a combined $128 million \u2014 more than double the sum at this point in the 2020 cycle and far surpassing every other previous one. Top House members are now raising $1 million or more per quarter. And more than two dozen senators and Senate candidates topped that threshold.Candidate after candidate, and the parties themselves, are posting record-breaking sums, even as the shapes of most House districts nationwide remain in flux because of delays in the once-a-decade redrawing of boundaries.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesIn Georgia, Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, raised more than $100,000 per day in the past three months for a $9.5 million haul. But his leading Republican rival, Herschel Walker, the former football player who was urged to run by former President Donald Trump, raised $3.7 million in a little more than a month, setting up a potentially bruising and expensive contest in that key state.Politicians in both parties are furiously racing to expand their online donor bases while simultaneously courting big checks from wealthy benefactors. At a Senate Republican retreat for big donors in Palm Beach, Florida, this past week, Trump\u2019s presence was a reminder of his continued perch at the center of the Republican Party \u2014 both in helping lure donations and in derailing whatever messaging that party operatives have designed.\u201cThe donor community is waking up to the fact that the Republican Party has a historic opportunity in 2022, in spite of Trump continuing to talk about 2020,\u201d said Scott Reed, a longtime Republican strategist.Story continuesMoney alone is rarely decisive in political races, especially when both parties are flush with cash. But the glut of political funding, detailed in Federal Election Commission reports filed Friday by House and Senate candidates and announced by the parties, shows the growing stakes of U.S. elections, where a single flipped Senate seat can shift trillions of dollars in federal spending.The country\u2019s increasingly polarized electorate has been hyper-engaged in politics since the Trump era began, and the ease of channeling that energy into donations online is remaking how campaigns are funded. The online donation clearinghouses for the two parties, ActBlue and WinRed, processed a combined total of more than $450 million in the third quarter.The avalanche of cash could expand the 2022 political battlefield and result in an unrelenting wave of advertising aimed at Americans who live in swing districts and states.The ad wars have, in fact, already begun. Democratic- and Republican-linked groups are spending millions of dollars to shape public opinion on the spending package currently being debated in Congress.Among them is one Biden-aligned nonprofit group, Building Back Together, which said it had spent nearly $15 million on television ads in more than two dozen House districts and key states since July. This past week, a Republican-aligned nonprofit group, One Nation, announced that it was beginning a $10 million ad campaign, urging three Democratic senators up for reelection in 2022 \u2014 in Nevada, Arizona and New Hampshire \u2014 to oppose the spending package.All told, more than $70 million has been spent since Sept. 1 on television ads related to the Biden legislative agenda, according to AdImpact, a media-tracking firm.Historically, the party out of power has done well in a new president\u2019s first midterm election, and Republicans see rising inflation, missteps in Afghanistan and a softening in Biden\u2019s approval rating as reasons for a sunny 2022 outlook.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to really screw up to lose the House,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, referring to the Democrats\u2019 narrow majority in that chamber.He said that recapturing the Senate, which is split evenly between 50 Republicans and 50 members of the Democratic caucus, would depend on recruiting more top-tier Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.At the donor retreat in Florida, Graham said, \u201cthere was a sense of optimism that was as high as I\u2019ve seen it.\u201dIn the House, the path to the majority is widely expected to be determined by suburban voters, who swung sharply toward the Democratic Party during the Trump administration.Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who has worked on House campaigns, noted that the central role of suburban terrain \u2014 the battlegrounds were more rural 15 years ago \u2014 had driven up the cost of campaigning. Buying ads to reach suburban voters requires advertising in pricier urban television markets.\u201cThe upside is the Democratic coalition is built around suburbs,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe downside is the resources to run in Philadelphia and Chicago and LA and Miami.\u201dThe National Republican Congressional Committee began this year with roughly $8 million less on hand than its Democratic counterpart but entered October with roughly $2 million more, as small digital contributions have accelerated for Republicans. Each group has raised well over $100 million this year.Rep. Tom Emmer, the chairman of the Republican congressional committee, noted in a call with reporters that in the 2020 cycle, his party committee had not reached the $100 million threshold until February \u2014 five months later.Both the Senate and the House Republican campaign committees have leaned on hardball and sometimes deceptive tactics to boost their bottom lines, such as pre-checking boxes that automatically enroll donors in recurring monthly contributions and aggressively fostering guilt trips in supporters and questioning their allegiances.\u201cYou\u2019re a traitor \u2026\u201d began one such House GOP text this past week. \u201cYou abandoned Trump.\u201dThe text gave a false deadline of 17 minutes to donate.\u201cThis is your final chance to prove your loyalty or be branded a deserter,\u201d it read.The House GOP committee, which declined to comment on its tactics, said it had raised nearly 44% of its funds last quarter online.\u201cDemocrats have owned online fundraising, and that is no longer true,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, who previously led the House Republican campaign arm. \u201cRepublicans now are the ones who are obsessed and aroused. People voted for Biden to get Trump out of their living rooms. But they didn\u2019t vote for all his policies.\u201dMost Republican strategists hope to keep the focus on Democrats, knowing voters typically want to put a check on those in power. But Trump\u2019s continued insistence on making his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen a central rallying cry for the GOP \u2014 \u201cIf we don\u2019t solve the Presidential Election Fraud of 2020,\u201d Trump warned in a statement this past week, \u201cRepublicans will not be voting in \u201922 or \u201924\u201d \u2014 is a complicating factor.\u201cIf it\u2019s a referendum on Biden\u2019s policies, we will do very well,\u201d Graham said of the 2022 midterms. \u201cIf it\u2019s looking back, if it\u2019s a grievance campaign, then we could be in trouble.\u201dEmmer tried to distance himself from Trump\u2019s remarks, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a private citizen, and he, of course, is entitled to his own opinion.\u201d Still, Emmer added that he was \u201chonored\u201d that the former president would headline the committee\u2019s fall fundraising dinner.\u201cHe remains the biggest draw in our party,\u201d he said.Congressional leaders are the other leading party fundraisers. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican minority leader, and his top deputy, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, have transferred a combined total of nearly $30 million to their party committees this year, party officials said.Scalise\u2019s top donations since July included $105,000 from the PAC of Koch Industries; $125,000 from H. Fisk Johnson, the chief executive of S.C. Johnson & Son; and $66,300 from John W. Childs, the private equity magnate.Whether this is the final term of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is 81, is widely discussed in Washington. But the San Francisco Democrat remains a prolific fundraiser.Donors to her political accounts in recent months include Haim Saban, the media investor ($263,400); Hamilton James, a top Blackstone executive ($263,000); Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, the Cargill heiress ($263,400); and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood producer ($163,400).Sen. Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, raised heavily both for his own 2022 reelection bid in New York and to maintain the Democratic majority.Schumer has aggressively pressed top party fundraisers in recent months, telling one that he wanted to fill his war chest (now at $31.9 million) as a deterrent to any primary challenge from the left. He specifically named Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York as the kind of candidate he would like to keep from running, mostly to avoid weakening his hand while navigating the evenly divided Senate.Schumer\u2019s office declined to comment.Notably, some of the top fundraisers in both parties are Black.They include Warnock, the top Democratic fundraiser aside from congressional leaders, and Walker, a leading Republican in the Georgia Senate race. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the lone Black Republican in the Senate, was the top fundraiser in the party aside from the congressional leaders.Scott raised $8.3 million in the third quarter. He now has $18.8 million in the bank, funds that can be used for his 2022 reelection or to seed a potential 2024 presidential run.Rep. Val Demings, a Black Democrat in Florida and a former Orlando police chief, is challenging Sen. Marco Rubio, the Republican incumbent, and was another top fundraiser, pulling in $8.4 million. But she spent heavily to do so: $5.6 million.Florida has proved elusive for Democratic candidates, especially in recent years, and some party strategists are already quietly grumbling about the tens of millions \u2014 if not more \u2014 that is likely to be poured in to a tough race, especially after hundreds of millions of dollars was spent on losing 2020 efforts to topple Republican incumbents in Maine, Iowa, North Carolina and South Carolina.\u00a9 2021 The New York Times Company", "preprocessed": "presid donald trump fist bump herschel walker former nfl player event black econom empower

HunnicuttWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday vowed to move forward with policing reform, telling a gathering honoring slain officers that their profession is called on to do too much.\"We expect you to be everything,\" Biden said in a speech in front of the U.S. Capitol, mourning 491 law enforcement officers who died at work in 2019 and 2020. \"We expect everything of you.\"And it's beyond the capacity of anyone to meet the total expectations,\" he said. \"Being a cop today is one hell of a lot harder than it's ever been.\"Biden's own drafting of his remarks came as he learned of a shooting earlier on Saturday in Houston, which left one deputy dead and two injured. Biden expressed sorrow for the incident.Biden has been a loyal ally to law enforcement, dating back to his days in the Senate when he crafted a 1994 crime bill with their help.But his support for broad reforms following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis by an officer created some tension with police groups opposed to some of the reforms promoted by Democrats.The National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), a major officers' union which sponsored Saturday's event, endorsed Biden's Republican opponent Donald Trump in the 2020 election.Efforts to reach a bipartisan police reform deal failed in September https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-are-refusing-back-police-reforms-trump-supported-white-house-2021-09-22, marking a setback for the Democratic president, who campaigned on taking such action.Biden on Saturday credited the FOP with \"sincerely trying to reach an agreement.\" He added, \"We haven't gotten there,\" but \"must\" do so.The president said he would work to get police departments the support and funding they need.

In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.Story continuesClinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination.

(Gabriella Demczuk/The New York Times)WASHINGTON \u2014 No gainfully employed person can predict what their workload will look like the moment their children arrive, or how taxing it will be to put those responsibilities aside and care for a newborn 24/7 \u2014 let alone two of them. For Pete Buttigieg, the Department of Transportation secretary, that moment came just as political stakes for his boss were rising.After a year spent trying to adopt, Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, welcomed twins named Penelope Rose and Joseph August in August. The babies arrived amid the delay of a bipartisan infrastructure bill and growing concerns over product shortages and the sluggish transport of goods, inconveniences that have only grown more biting as the pandemic continues.On Friday, Buttigieg\u2019s twins cooed in the background as he spoke by phone about the \u201cpro-family\u201d policies in the Biden White House that enabled him to take paid time off. But then he shared a truism that countless people who have had children learned the hard way, and one that very few men in power have talked about.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\u201cThe big thing is having a newly personal appreciation for the fact that this is work,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIt may be time away from a professional role, but it\u2019s very much time on.\u201dTaking time with his family meant that Buttigieg, who is admired inside the administration for his deftness as a public speaker and on-camera surrogate, was not front and center as infrastructure and supply chain discussions unfolded. He took four weeks of paid leave from his role where he was mostly offline but said he was able to delegate responsibilities during leave or log on remotely for higher-priority work.Buttigieg said that everyone in the White House, which sanctioned his leave as a Cabinet member, had been \u201cwonderfully supportive.\u201d (As a senator, President Joe Biden made it clear to staff in a memo that they were allowed to put family obligations before work.) But, Buttigieg said, taking paid leave \u201cshouldn\u2019t be up to your particular good fortune\u201d or the graces of an employer.Story continuesButtigieg said he was now better positioned to plead the case for better leave policies, although he expected he would be more focused on the particulars of the infrastructure bill than the parental leave provisions.Still, conservatives questioned Buttigieg\u2019s decision to take time off as legislation hangs in the balance and amid a supply chain crisis. Loudest among them, as usual, was Tucker Carlson of Fox News: \u201cPaternity leave, they call it, trying to figure out how to breastfeed. No word on how that went.\u201d (Buttigieg said later that Carlson might not understand the concept of bottle feeding.)Carlson\u2019s comments were criticized as sexist and \u2014 since Buttigieg is the first openly gay Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate \u2014 homophobic. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., criticized Buttigieg\u2019s performance as \u201cso bad that Americans didn\u2019t even realize he spent the last two months absent on paternity leave,\u201d an insult that exaggerated how long the secretary was out of the office.Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., the first senator in history to give birth while in office, said those comments only highlighted the gender discrimination that fathers continue to face when they take parental leave.\u201cIt is important for him to set the standard for other folks and make it acceptable,\u201d Duckworth said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just as important for fathers to be there as mothers to be there.\u201dResearch shows that parental leave helps fathers bond with their children, and a growing number of companies have extended benefits to fathers, but there is still evidence that men \u2014 in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 feel more pressure to remain on the job rather than take time off to spend with their babies.The White House has stood behind Buttigieg\u2019s decision. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter on Friday that he was a role model when it came to demonstrating \u201cthe importance of paid leave for new parents.\u201dAt different points throughout their time in Washington, the Buttigieges have used their influence as public figures to advance cultural discussions and subvert commonly held ideas about the relationship dynamics of powerful people.\u201cPeople are accustomed to politics looking a different way, and you\u2019re here to make sure that, you know, it can look a different way,\u201d Chasten Buttigieg said in an interview with The New York Times in the spring.The next frontier for the Buttigieges is parenthood, and Pete Buttigieg said they are learning on the (unpaid) job what research has made clear: Time allowed for parents to bond with their children after birth is crucial for development.And yet, Americans receive no mandated paid federal leave. (The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act provides for up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off.)When both parents are able to take leave, it eases a burden that has historically fallen on parents who remain at home. Some nine states and the District of Columbia, where the Buttigieges live, have or plan to institute some version of paid family leave. Federal workers can receive up to 12 weeks\u2019 paid leave.That time has been shorter or nonexistent for Cabinet members, who are not subject to federal leave provisions. A spokesperson for Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told Politico that Castro took a \u201cweek or so\u201d of leave after his child was born.Buttigieg\u2019s decision to take time off came at another pivotal moment for the administration: Biden is trying to get his party to agree on the particulars of a sprawling bill that would include 12 weeks of paid parental leave. It is unclear whether the provision will survive negotiations with the party\u2019s centrists, who have demanded a smaller price tag in order for the plan to pass. But supporters of the parental leave provision argue it is a necessity for America to remain competitive.\u201cIf we remain one of the only countries in the world without paid leave during an ongoing pandemic, that will be an added tragedy and a failure of our government,\u201d Dawn Huckelbridge, director of Paid Leave for All, said in an interview. \u201cWhat I hope comes out of this is a reminder that every single one of us is going to have to give and receive care in our lifetimes.\u201dThis week, Buttigieg began ramping up at work again by joining meetings with the president and appearing for media interviews, though a spokesperson said he would take more time off in the future to be with his family.On Friday, Buttigieg spoke about his time on leave as he prepared to appear on Fox News and, later, MSNBC. His time off allowed him to see that his children, now 2 months old, have different personalities and that they prefer sleeping on their fathers\u2019 chests to any baby swing or bassinet.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to believe something as a matter of policy,\u201d Buttigieg said about his time off bonding with his twins. \u201cIt\u2019s another to live it and see how much of a difference it could make.\u201d\u00a9 2021 The New York Times Company", "preprocessed": "pete buttigieg transport secretari husband chasten walk dog washington march gabriella demczuk new york time

{"title": "Texas Republicans set to pass new congressional maps", "author": "ACACIA CORONADO", "date": "October 16, 2021, 9:53 AM", "body": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Republicans on Saturday were set to approve redrawn U.S. House maps that would shore up their eroding dominance as voters peel away from the GOP in the state's booming suburbs.After passage in the Texas House, the maps will go to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign them into law.The redrawn congressional districts map make it easier for incumbents to hold their seats and may blunt Black and Hispanic communities' political influence, even as those voters drive Texas' growth. The new lines, the product of a once-in-a-decade redistricting process, create two new districts  and make several less competitive for Republican lawmakers. The proposal does not create any additional districts where Black or Hispanic voters make up a majority, even as people of color accounted for more than  9 of 10 new residents in Texas over the past decade.Democrats and voting rights advocates are preparing to challenge the maps in court in what would be yet another high-profile, high-stakes legal battle over Texas politics \u2014 already the epicenter of disputes over abortion  and voting rights.State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat from San Antonio, said the maps were drawn to keep incumbent GOP lawmakers in power and \u201cisolate communities of color\u201d \u2014 who lean Democratic \u2014 in a way that limits their ability to determine the outcome of election. Gutierrez said he expects to see legal challenges alleging both racial discrimination and procedural missteps by the map\u2019s authors.Texas was the only state to gain two congressional seats following the 2020 census.Republicans who control both chambers of the Legislature have nearly complete control of the mapmaking process. They are working from maps that experts and courts have already declared as gerrymandered in their favor, and the state has had to defend their maps in court after every redistricting process since the Voting Rights Act took effect in 1965.Story continuesBut legal challenges face new hurdles this round \u2014 the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Texas and other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need to have the Justice Department scrutinize the maps before they are approved. Plaintiffs must now wait to file claims and must show that maps were intentionally meant to discriminate by race. Drawing maps to engineer a political advantage is not unconstitutional.Gutierrez contends a map drawn without taking race into account could yield as many as three new majority Hispanic districts and one new majority Black district.\u201cThere you have clear evidence that what they have done is racially gerrymandered, so that they can dilute the vote, so that they can stay in power,\u201d Gutierrez said.Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman, who authored the maps and leads the Senate Redistricting Committee, told fellow lawmakers that they were \u201cdrawn blind to race.\" She said her legal team ensured the proposal followed the Voting Rights Act.The proposal would make 24 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts safe Republican districts, with an opportunity to pick up at least one additional newly redrawn Democratic stronghold on the border with Mexico, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from last year's election collected by the Texas Legislative Council. Currently, Republicans hold 23 of the state's 36 seats.Republicans with newly fortified advantages include Rep. Van Taylor, whose district in Dallas' exurbs went for President Donald Trump by a single percentage point last year. Under the new maps, Trump would have won the district by double-digits.Rep. Michael McCaul, who Democrats aggressively targeted the last two cycles, would now represent a solidly pro-Trump district under lines that exclude Houston's suburbs and liberal parts of Austin.And a long, vertically drawn district stretching from the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio that President Joe Biden won by just over 2 percentage points would now slightly tilt toward Trump voters.Democrats, meanwhile, protested new lines that remove some of their longtime residents even as their seats are protected. U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who is serving her 14th term, would have her home drawn out of her Houston district as well as 200,000 of her former constituents. She could still run for reelection.Texas lawmakers are also redrawing the maps for their own districts, with Republicans following a similar plan  that would keep their party in power in the state House and Senate. Those proposals are also expected to be sent to Abbott by next week.Jen Ramos, political associate for Jolt Initiative, an advocacy group that promotes Latino civic participation, said the new maps showed a dilution of power in majority Latino areas such as the Rio Grande Valley.\u201cTexas should look and sound like its elected officials and elected officials should not pick their constituents,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cConstituents should pick their representatives.\u201dGina Castaneda, 66, drove from her home south of San Antonio to Austin early Wednesday to testify against the maps. Castaneda, who is Hispanic and politically conservative, said her neighborhood alone is split into three congressional districts.\u201cThe way the census is going, and I have said this for many years, Hispanics are going to be the majority minority,\u201d Castaneda said. \u201cWe need to make sure that the representation is there and we are able to fight the battle with our elected officials.\u201d___Associated Press writer Paul J.

Ken Weyler was known around the New Hampshire Statehouse for dismissing the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and opposing tens of millions of dollars in federal funds to promote vaccinations.But when the 79-year-old Weyler, a retired commercial pilot and Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate who chaired the legislature's powerful fiscal committee, sent a 52-page report likening vaccines to \u201corganized mass murder,\" Republican leaders were compelled to act.\u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone who agrees with it. It\u2019s absolute craziness,\u201d said Republican House Speaker Sherman Packard, who quickly accepted Weyler's resignation from his committee post.The episode was especially piercing in New Hampshire, where the previous House speaker died of COVID-19 last year. It has also exposed Republicans' persistent struggle to root out the misinformation that has taken hold in its ranks across the country.A year and a half into the pandemic, surveys show Republicans are less worried about the threat from COVID-19 or its variants, less confident in science, less likely to be vaccinated than Democrats and independents and more opposed to vaccine mandates.It's a combination of views that comes with clear health risks \u2014 and potential political consequences. In a place like New Hampshire, where Republicans are hoping to win back congressional seats next year, politicians with fringe views stand to distract voters from the party\u2019s agenda, driving away independents and moderates.The risk is particularly clear in \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d New Hampshire, where the fight over vaccines has activated the libertarian wing of the GOP. The divisions have the potential to dominate Republican primaries next year.\u201cWhat I wonder over the next year is whether all of this is the tip of the iceberg or the whole iceberg,\u201d Dante Scala, political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said.Republicans in New Hampshire have struggled to unify around a common position since the pandemic first emerged.Story continuesRepublican Gov. Chris Sununu has been widely praised for his handling of the pandemic, but has also come under fire from conservative critics. They have pushed back on his state of emergency, which put limits on business operations and public gatherings, often holding rowdy protests, including some at his house.Sununu, who is eyeing a run for Senate next year against Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, joined other Republican leaders in opposing a federal vaccine mandate. But that did little to placate his critics, who repeatedly shouted down fellow Republicans during a press conference last month to protest the federal mandate.Holding signs saying \u201cI will die before I comply\u201d and including one protester with an automatic weapon strapped to his back, the crowd took over the podium and put up their own speakers who predicted, without evidence, that the mandate would force the state's hospitals to close.The opposition from Republican leaders to federal vaccine mandates prompted one Republican lawmaker, Rep. William Marsh, to switch parties.\u201cThe belief that is being put forward is that their individual rights trump everything, that no one has the right to impose, in this particular case, a vaccine mandate on a person ever,\" said Marsh, a retired ophthalmologist, who was the vice chair on the House Health and Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee. \u201cI am of the belief that, for people in a civilized society, individual rights are limited once they start to impinge on the rights of others.\"The Weyler controversy started last month when he first questioned Health and Human Services data about hospitalizations in the state. He suggested most of those hospitalized had been vaccinated, which prompted the state's health commissioner to accuse him of spreading misinformation. In fact, 90% of those hospitalized had not been vaccinated, she said.Gallup polling from September found 57% of Democrats are very or somewhat worried about getting the coronavirus compared with 18% of Republicans. The Democrats are also more confident that vaccines will protect against new variants and more confidence in science \u2014 79% compared to 45% of Republicans..Weyler was among a group of Republican lawmakers who are so opposed to the Biden administration's vaccine mandates that they pushed to reject millions in federal funding meant to assist with vaccination efforts. This week, $27 million was rejected by a Republican-controlled Executive Council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts, despite calls from Sununu to accept the funding.The money would have allowed the state to hire a public health manager and a dozen workers to address public vaccine concerns. But opponents feared it would have required the state to comply with any \u201cfuture directives\u201d issued by the Biden administration regarding COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates.After the vote, Sununu was forced to push back against a suggestion that this is the new Republican Party stance.\u201cI don\u2019t believe most of the people protesting were part of the Republican Party.

"Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APInternal party warfare between progressive and moderate Democrats over Joe Biden\u2019s $3.5tn tax-and-spending package has burst dramatically into the open after Vermont senator Bernie Sanders launched a thinly veiled attack on West Virginia senator Joe Manchin in an op-ed published in the centrist Democrat\u2019s home-state newspaper.Related: Is Hunter Biden\u2019s art project painting the president into an ethical corner?Sanders, writing in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, described opponents of the legislation as \u201cevery Republican in Congress as well as the drug companies, the insurance companies, the fossil fuel industry and the billionaire class\u201d.He added that opponents of the bill support a status quo \u201cin which the very rich get richer while ordinary Americans continue to struggle to make ends meet\u201d.Joe Biden\u2019s proposed legislation is an ambitious package on policies such as free education, the climate crisis and healthcare provision that its proponents liken to the domestic reforms of the 1960s Great Society and the 1930s New Deal.However, it has run up against opposition from a group of centrist and conservative Democrats \u2013 often spearheaded by Manchin \u2013 who balk at its price tag and some of the programs it embraces.Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, said polls showed \u201coverwhelming support for this legislation\u201d.\u201cYet, the political problem we face is that in a 50-50 Senate we need every Democratic senator to vote yes. We now have only 48. Two Democratic senators remain in opposition, including senator Joe Manchin,\u201d he said.The other senator Sanders was referring to is Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.The column provoked swift pushback from Manchin. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time an out-of-stater has tried to tell West Virginians what is best for them, despite having no relationship to our state,\u201d he said a tweet.Last month, Manchin said he would not vote for the bill, called the Build Back Better plan, that he characterized again on Friday a \u201creckless expansion of government programs\u201d.Story continuesThe exchange comes as the full spending package looks increasingly unlikely to pass in its current form, and the progressive-centrist impasse has paralyzed Biden\u2019s domestic reform agenda and action to match his administration\u2019s commitment to combatting climate change.Central to the dispute between Sanders and Manchin is the Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP), a $150bn program within the spending bill, designed to speed the conversion of US electric power generation from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Manchin\u2019s home state is the second largest producer of coal, after Wyoming, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and Manchin has argued that utilities should not receive federal funds for an energy transition they are already making.Manchin is also chairman of the Senate energy and natural resources committee, and holds power over energy components in the bill. He has indicated he aims to reduce the $3.5tn price tag of the spending bill to $1.5tn.But simply dropping the clean energy provision from the proposed legislation would come as major embarrassment to the administration ahead of Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow next month, where Biden will be in the spotlight over matching verbal commitment to climate initiatives with legislative action.In taking the fight to West Virginia, Sanders is redoubling pressure on his party colleague.In comments to reporters last week, Sanders said: \u201cThe time is long overdue for him to tell us with specificity \u2013 not generalities, but beyond generalities, with specificity \u2013 what he wants and what he does not want, and to explain that to the people of West Virginia and America.\u201dFrom ringside, the White House continues to express its commitment to a compromise solutions to get the economic package, even if it does not reach its full measure of spending.\u201cI\u2019m convinced we\u2019re going to get it done. We\u2019re not going to get $3.5tn. We\u2019ll get less than that, but we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d Biden said Friday.White House Press secretary Jen Psaki described the impasse as an example of \u201cdemocracy working.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes down to it, no bill is perfect,\u201d Psaki said on a podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be everything that Joe Biden wants, it\u2019s not going to be everything Joe Manchin wants.\u201d", "preprocessed": "photograph j scott applewhit apintern parti warfar progress moder democrat joe biden tn tax spend packag burst dramat open vermont senat berni sander launch thinli veil attack west virginia senat joe manchin op ed publish centrist democrat home state newspap relat hunter biden art project paint presid ethic corner sander write charleston gazett mail describ oppon legisl everi republican congress well drug compani insur compani fossil fuel industri billionair class ad oppon bill support statu quo rich get richer ordinari american continu struggl make end meet joe biden propos legisl ambiti packag polici free educ climat crisi healthcar provis propon liken domest reform great societi new deal howev run opposit group centrist conserv democrat often spearhead manchin balk price tag program embrac sander democrat socialist vermont said poll show overwhelm support legisl yet polit problem face senat need everi democrat senat vote ye two democrat senat remain opposit includ senat joe manchin said senat sander refer kyrsten sinema arizona column provok swift pushback manchin first time stater tri tell west virginian best despit relationship state said tweet last month manchin said would vote bill call build back better plan character friday reckless expans govern program stori continuesth exchang come full spend packag look increasingli unlik pas current form progress centrist impass paralyz biden domest reform agenda action match administr commit combat climat chang central disput sander manchin clean electr perform program cepp bn program within spend bill design speed convers u electr power gener fossil fuel renew energi manchin home state second largest produc coal wyom accord u energi inform administr manchin argu util receiv feder fund energi transit alreadi make manchin also chairman senat energi natur resourc committe hold power energi compon bill indic aim reduc tn price tag spend bill tn simpli drop clean energi provis propos legisl would come major embarrass administr ahead cop climat summit glasgow next month biden spotlight match verbal commit climat initi legisl action take fight west virginia sander redoubl pressur parti colleagu comment report last week sander said time long overdu tell u specif gener beyond gener specif want want explain peopl west virginia america ringsid white hous continu express commit compromis solut get econom packag even reach full measur spend convinc go get done go get tn get le go get biden said friday white hous press secretari jen psaki describ impass exampl democraci work come bill perfect psaki said podcast go everyth joe biden want go everyth joe manchin want"}, {"title": "Winemaking and marathon running: what Kyrsten Sinema does instead of her job", "author": "Luke O'Neil", "date": "October 16, 2021, 7:00 AM", "body": "Serving in the US Senate is a pretty good gig if you can get it. You\u2019re paid $174,000 a year, only have to show up around 200 days and you almost always snag an even better-compensated private sector gig when you retire or lose an election.For all these perks, all you have to do is occasionally give a thumbs up or down on matters of serious import. Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema seems to enjoy all of those aspects of her job besides the last one.Sinema, and her fellow conservative lawmaker Joe Manchin, remain the two Democrat holdouts against passing Joe Biden\u2019s would-be sweeping Build Back Better agenda. The duo are effectively holding an array of social spending proposals in limbo \u2013 including the parts that would stop people dying, give under-fives a better start in life and meaningfully address climate change. Aid for real people across the country, and the planet itself, is being forestalled.Manchin has been direct in the specifics of his opposition, but Sinema has said she doesn\u2019t want to make public what her opposition to the bill is. She\u2019s far from a private person though \u2013 here\u2019s how she seems to prefer spending her time besides doing what her voters ostensibly sent her to Washington to do.Making wineMaking wineEarlier this year it was reported by Business Insider that Sinema has spent a couple of weeks interning at the Three Sticks winery in Sonoma, California. For her work at the facility she was paid $1,117.40. Sinema\u2019s appreciation for wine has been well documented on her social media accounts, so it\u2019s possible it\u2019s just a coincidence that the owner of the winery in question is William S Price III, a cofounder of TPG Capital, one of the biggest private equity firms in the world, which has spent more than $3m lobbying politicians in the past couple of years.RunningRunningNot that type of running. Sinema has spent the past year training for long-distance runs. An avid athlete, she has competed in the Boston Marathon before, but had to pull out of the contest this month after injuring herself in another race in Washington over the summer.Story continuesTravelingTravelingThis week it was reported that Sinema has traveled to Europe for a fundraising jag. It was unclear whether she, in addition to participating in events to raise money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was holding private fundraising events of her own. Sinema\u2019s itinerary for the trip remains a secret but she is believed to be visiting Paris and London.FundraisingFundraisingAs Democrats scrambled to find a solution to the budget impasse earlier this month, Sinema left Washington abruptly on a Friday for what she said was a medical appointment. Also on the agenda that weekend was a donor\u2019s retreat at a luxury spa in Phoenix. That same week, Sinema held another fundraising meeting with industry groups opposed to Biden\u2019s agenda. During the the 45-minute meeting the groups were invited to write checks for $1,000 to $5,800 to her election fund. All told, Sinema has received at least $750,000 from pharmaceutical interests and $920,000 from other industry lobbies.TeachingTeachingSinema has been teaching at Arizona State University since 2003, holding between two and three courses a semester. Among her recurring classes is one called Developing Grants and Fundraising. As the course description explains, the class is designed to teach students \u201chow to cultivate donors\u201d through \u201copportunistic fundraising.\u201d", "preprocessed": "serv u senat pretti good gig get paid year show around day almost alway snag even better compens privat sector gig retir lose elect perk occasion give thumb matter seriou import arizona kyrsten sinema seem enjoy aspect job besid last one sinema fellow conserv lawmak joe manchin remain two democrat holdout pas joe biden would sweep build back better agenda duo effect hold array social spend propos limbo includ part would stop peopl die give five better start life meaning address climat chang aid real peopl across countri planet forestal manchin direct specif opposit sinema said want make public opposit bill far privat person though seem prefer spend time besid voter ostens sent washington make winemak wineearli year report busi insid sinema spent coupl week intern three stick wineri sonoma california work facil paid sinema appreci wine well document social medium account possibl coincid owner wineri question william price iii cofound tpg capit one biggest privat equiti firm world spent lobbi politician past coupl year runningrunningnot type run sinema spent past year train long distanc run avid athlet compet boston marathon pull contest month injur anoth race washington summer stori continuestravelingtravelingthi week report sinema travel europ fundrais jag unclear whether addit particip event rais money democrat senatori campaign committe hold privat fundrais event sinema itinerari trip remain secret believ visit pari london fundraisingfundraisinga democrat scrambl find solut budget impass earlier month sinema left washington abruptli friday said medic appoint also agenda weekend donor retreat luxuri spa phoenix week sinema held anoth fundrais meet industri group oppos biden agenda minut meet group invit write check elect fund told sinema receiv least pharmaceut interest industri lobbi teachingteachingsinema teach arizona state univers sinc hold two three cours semest among recur class one call develop grant fundrais cours descript explain class design teach student cultiv donor opportunist fundrais"}, {"title": "Missouri governor is calling for criminal charges against a journalist who found social security numbers exposed on a public website", "author": "Aaron Holmes", "date": "October 16, 2021, 7:45 AM", "body": "Missouri Gov.

Mike Parson labeled the reporter a \"hacker\" and demanded an investigation - which cyber experts say makes no sense.Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is demanding a criminal investigation into a journalist who found social security numbers exposed on a state website - a reaction that cybersecurity experts say makes no sense.On Wednesday, St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Josh Renaud published a story revealing that the state's education department website exposed the SSNs of over 100,000 employees including teachers and administrators. All Renaud had to do to view the SSNs was open \"inspect element\" to view the page's source code, which anyone can do with two clicks of a mouse.Renaud first disclosed the exposure to the state on Tuesday and waited until the issue was fixed before publishing his story - a well-established best practice in cybersecurity reporting.But after the story went live, Parson held a press conference Thursday slamming Renaud as a \"hacker\" and calling on state prosecutors to conduct a criminal investigation into his report.\"We will not let this crime against Missouri teachers go unpunished,\" Parson said. \"They were acting against a state agency to compromise teachers' personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines for their news outlet.\"Parson's remarks have been met by widespread bewilderment and outrage from cybersecurity experts, who say Renaud disclosed the exposed data responsibly and that using a web browser's \"inspect element\" tool does not constitute hacking.\"Hitting F12 in a browser is not hacking,\" SocialProof Security CEO Rachel Tobac said in a tweet. \"Fix your website.\" Another cybersecurity researcher, Matt Blaze, admonished Parson for moving to \"call the cops\" on someone who \"quite responsibly\" disclosed the vulnerability.Story continuesA day after Parson's press conference, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly tweeted that the agency relies on researchers who \"find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities\" - a message interpreted by some to reference Parson's remarks. A CISA spokesperson declined to comment beyond Easterly's tweet when reached by Insider.-Jen Easterly (@CISAJen) October 15, 2021Despite Parson's bluster, it's unlikely that any criminal charges will be filed against Renaud. As TechCrunch reports, a recent Supreme Court ruling found that in order to violate federal anti-hacking laws, a person has to obtain information from a computer that they can't normally access - meaning information available on a public website is unlikely to be considered off-limits.St. Louis Post-Dispatch publisher Ian Caso said in a statement that the newspaper stands by Renaud, who \"did everything right.\"\"It's regrettable the governor has chosen to deflect blame onto the journalists who uncovered the website's problem,\" Caso said.Read the original article on Business Insider", "preprocessed": "missouri gov mike parson jeff roberson apth governor missouri call crimin charg report found social secur number expo onlin report found ssn teacher viewabl govern site gov mike parson label report hacker demand investig cyber expert say make sen missouri gov mike parson demand crimin investig journalist found social secur number expo state websit reaction cybersecur expert say make sen wednesday st loui post dispatch report josh renaud publish stori reveal state educ depart websit expo ssn employe includ teacher administr renaud view ssn open inspect element view page sourc code anyon two click mous renaud first disclos exposur state tuesday wait issu fix publish stori well establish best practic cybersecur report stori went live parson held press confer thursday slam renaud hacker call state prosecutor conduct crimin investig report let crime missouri teacher go unpunish parson said act state agenc compromis teacher person inform attempt embarrass state sell headlin news outlet parson remark met widespread bewilder outrag cybersecur expert say renaud disclos expo data respons use web browser inspect element tool constitut hack hit f browser hack socialproof secur ceo rachel tobac said tweet fix websit anoth cybersecur research matt blaze admonish parson move call cop someon quit respons disclos vulner stori continuesa day parson press confer cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc director jen easterli tweet agenc reli research find respons disclos vulner messag interpret refer parson remark cisa spokesperson declin comment beyond easterli tweet reach insid jen easterli cisajen octob despit parson bluster unlik crimin charg file renaud techcrunch report recent suprem court rule found order violat feder anti hack law person obtain inform comput normal access mean inform avail public websit unlik consid limit st loui post dispatch publish ian caso said statement newspap stand renaud everyth right regrett governor chosen deflect blame onto journalist uncov websit problem caso said read origin articl busi insid"}, {"title": "Adam Schiff says appointing Kevin McCarthy to the House speaker role would be like appointing Donald Trump", "author": "Yelena Dzhanova", "date": "October 16, 2021, 6:16 AM", "body": "Rep.

Brian Kemp, who like Raffensperger refused Trump\u2019s calls to undermine the 2020 result.\u201cWe have people who are running explicitly on the platform that the election results would have turned out different if they were in power in 2020, and I think it\u2019s going to be up to the voters in the place where they do elect their election officials to say, regardless of party, it\u2019s not acceptable to politicize the elections,\u201d Larry Norden, director of the election reform program at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, said.In Georgia, Hice has held himself up as an unabashed Trump defender.\u201cNobody understands the disaster of the lack of election integrity like the people of Georgia, and now is our hour to take it back,\u201d Hice told the crowd after Trump invited him on stage at his rally last month in the state. \u201cWe've got incredible leadership from President Trump, and we need this kind of leadership again.\u201dTrump also is backing Kristina Karamo, a Detroit poll challenger during the 2020 election, for secretary of state in Michigan, where Democratic incumbent Jocelyn Benson and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are top GOP targets next year. Karamo headlined a rally Tuesday at the Michigan Capitol, where speakers spread disproven voter fraud theories and demanded an Arizona-style election review.Secretary of state races are typically sleepy affairs, with lesser-known candidates who are dependent on their party\u2019s nominees for governor or Senate to carry them across the finish line. Trump\u2019s involvement could change that, said Trey Grayson, a Republican and former secretary of state in Kentucky.\u201cHe appears to be picking his own team based upon the criteria that I\u2019ll call the lie about the 2020 election,\u201d Grayson added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen anything like this.\u201dArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2022, believes there is an \u201cappetite for accountability\u201d that has elevated secretaries of state like her who have pushed back on GOP election lies.\u201cAll of this focus on rehashing the 2022 election based on baseless allegations is holding us back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s out of touch.\u201dA Yahoo News/YouGov poll in August found that two-thirds of Republicans believe the last election was stolen from Trump. And there was a deep partisan split in a CNN poll last month that showed 75 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of Democrats said democracy was under attack.The dynamics could make GOP primaries particularly relevant next year. Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser who hosts a podcast with a large right-wing audience, has described a candidate\u2019s position on the 2020 election results as a \u201clitmus test\u201d for 2022.Bannon has welcomed to his show candidates like Finchem and taken an interest in Ohio\u2019s crowded Senate primary, where Trump hasn\u2019t endorsed, but Mandel and other GOP hopefuls have worked strenuously to impress the former president. Mandel, for example, visited Maricopa County during the audit and has won endorsements from Wendy Rogers, an Arizona state senator who championed the audit, and Jenna Ellis, a former Trump attorney known for promoting false election claims.Mandel, a former state treasurer, also has called for 2020 election reviews in all 50 states, including Republican-controlled Ohio, which Trump won by 8 points. He downplayed the suggestion that, by questioning the validity of election results everywhere, he risks discouraging Republicans from voting.Trump himself has fed this uncertainty, raising doubts without evidence about whether future elections will be conducted fairly and sending mixed messages about whether Republicans should bother casting ballots.\u201cIf we don\u2019t solve the Presidential Election Fraud of 2020, Republicans will not be voting in \u02bc22 or \u02bc24,\u201d Trump said in an emailed statement Wednesday. \u201cIt is the single most important thing for Republicans to do.\u201dNate Persily, an election expert and professor at Stanford Law School, doesn\u2019t believe that the false claims of widespread voter fraud will depress GOP turnout.\u201cThe allegations of voter fraud are more about defining a set of beliefs for a political tribe than it is about persuasiveness, trying to persuade a group about the utility of their vote,\u201d Persily said. \u201cI have not seen evidence in the U.S. that those kinds of messages lead to demobilization.\u201d", "preprocessed": "futur u elect ballot larg former presid donald trump let go past singl

PM", "body": "Photograph: ReutersA central component to the Biden administration\u2019s climate agenda could be dropped from the massive budget bill that is pending in Congress due to opposition from Senator Joe Manchin, according to a report in the New York Times on Friday.The White House will \u201clikely\u201d cut from its spending bill a program to replace coal- and gas-fired power plants in the US with wind, solar and nuclear energy, the Times reported, citing congressional staffers and lobbyists familiar with the matter.The Biden administration has previously said that its clean energy plans would swiftly cut planet-heating emissions, and estimates have suggested that it could save hundreds of thousands of lives from deadly air pollution. In August, Biden also set a goal for half of all new vehicle sales in the US to be electric by 2030, and tightened pollution standards for trucks and cars.Related: The climate disaster is here \u2013 this is what the future looks likeThe $150bn program that is in danger of being terminated would incentivize utilities to increase the amount of clean energy that they use and would issue penalties to those that do not switch to renewable energy.The Times reported that Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia who has been aggressively resisting pieces of Biden\u2019s agenda, has told the administration that he strongly opposes the clean electricity program. The White House is now rewriting a version of the legislation that excludes that climate provision, the paper said. The administration is reportedly trying to come up with other alternative policies that could further cut emissions.Manchin, as the Times noted, has personal financial ties to the coal industry.If Manchin\u2019s opposition does ultimately kill Biden\u2019s clean electricity program, it would be a huge setback for the administration\u2019s efforts to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cHe plans to gut Biden\u2019s climate plan, and with it the chances for swift global progress,\u201d tweeted Bill McKibben, the prominent environmentalist.Story continuesThe Times noted that Democrats could attempt to move forward with a clean electricity program as its own bill, but that the window of opportunity is closing.A spokesman for the White House declined to comment to the Times.Sam Runyon, a Manchin spokeswoman, did not directly comment on the report, but told the Guardian in an email, \u201cSenator Manchin has clearly expressed his concerns about using tax payer dollars to pay private companies to do things they\u2019re already doing. He continues to support efforts to combat climate change while protecting American energy independence and ensuring our energy reliability.\u201dIn July, a consortium of researchers reported that, out of a range of the Biden administration\u2019s policy proposals to tackle the climate crisis, a clean energy standard would offer the largest net benefits to the US.Manchin and Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema have repeatedly clashed with the Biden administration and progressive Democrats, threatening to derail the president\u2019s ambitious economic package.", "preprocessed": "photograph reutersa central compon biden administr climat agenda could drop massiv budget bill pend congress due opposit senat joe manchin accord report new york time friday white hous like cut spend bill program replac coal ga fire power plant u wind solar nuclear energi time report cite congression staffer lobbyist familiar matter biden administr previous said clean energi plan would swiftli cut planet heat emiss estim suggest could save hundr thousand live deadli air pollut august biden also set goal half new vehicl sale u electr tighten pollut standard truck car relat climat disast futur look liketh bn program danger termin would incentiv util increas amount clean energi use would issu penalti switch renew energi time report manchin centrist democrat west virginia aggress resist piec biden agenda told administr strongli oppos clean electr program white hous rewrit version legisl exclud climat provis paper said administr reportedli tri come altern polici could cut emiss manchin time note person financi tie coal industri manchin opposit ultim kill biden clean electr program would huge setback administr effort tackl climat crisi plan gut biden climat plan chanc swift global progress tweet bill mckibben promin environmentalist stori continuesth time note democrat could attempt move forward clean electr program bill window opportun close spokesman white hous declin comment time sam runyon manchin spokeswoman directli comment report told guardian email senat manchin clearli express concern use tax payer dollar pay privat compani thing alreadi continu support effort combat climat chang protect american energi independ ensur energi reliabl juli consortium research report rang biden administr polici propos tackl climat crisi clean energi standard would offer largest net benefit u manchin arizona senat kyrsten sinema repeatedli clash biden administr progress democrat threaten derail presid ambiti econom packag"}, {"title": "Is Hunter Biden\u2019s art project painting the president into an ethical corner?", "author": "David Smith in Washington", "date": "October 16, 2021, 3:00 AM", "body": "Photograph: Kris Connor/WireImageIt was another starry night in Hollywood. In a white-walled room at the Milk Studios art gallery, where a lone violinist played before a projected animation, musician Moby, artist Shepard Fairey and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti reportedly mingled with about 200 guests.On display were artworks that combine canvas, yupo paper, wood and metal with oil, acrylic, ink and the written word. Organizers hope they will sell for up to half a million dollars \u2013 unusually high for an emerging artist. But then, this artist also happens to be son of the president of the United States.Related: Republicans will try to create an 'ethics' trap for Democrats. Don't fall for it | David LittHunter Biden\u2019s potentially lucrative new career \u2013 he is represented by the Georges Berg\u00e8s Gallery in New York, which credits him with \u201cpowerful and impactful paintings ranging from photogenic to mixed media to the abstract\u201d \u2013 is presenting ethical headaches for a White House that has promised to lead by example.Experts have raised alarms that individuals might buy the artworks \u2013 expected to fetch between $75,000 and $500,000 \u2013 to try to curry favor and gain influence with Joe Biden. They also accuse Hunter of trading on his father\u2019s name and position in a manner that, while not illegal, flouts ethical norms.\u201cI find it deeply troubling,\u201d said Walter Shaub, who was director of the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama. \u201cMerely following the incredibly weak ethics rules that we have doesn\u2019t win you any points and the legalistic approach blinds you to obvious commonsense problems. And here we have an obvious problem.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a family member clearly trading on his father\u2019s name. The man has never sold a piece of art before, has never even juried into a community centre art show, but suddenly he\u2019s selling art at fantastical prices. There is simply no way anybody paid $75,000 for anything other than his name.\u201dBiden has always been a fierce defender of Hunter, 51, who has been dogged by controversies for years and whose tax affairs are currently under investigation by the justice department. Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to weaponise Hunter\u2019s problems for political gain in the 2020 presidential election fell flat.Story continuesThe sale of Hunter Biden\u2019s art is being handled by the George Berg\u00e8s Gallery in Soho, New York. An agreement stipulates that only the gallery will know the identity of purchasers. Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyEarlier this year Hunter published a memoir in which he detailed his struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse and denied wrongdoing in joining the board of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine, where he earned more than $50,000 a month from 2014 to 2019. Again, he did not inflict political damage on his father as some feared.But his latest pursuit, painting, could prove more complicated. Hunter said in a New York Times interview last year that he took it up as a hobby during his recovery from addiction and found solace in art when he was at the centre of Trump\u2019s 2019 impeachment trial.I would be amazed, you know, if my art had sold at, um, you know, for $10Hunter BidenIn July he told the Nota Bene: This Week in the Art World podcast that art prices are \u201ccompletely subjective\u201d, insisting: \u201cLook, man, I never set my prices \u2013 what my art was going to cost, what it costs or how much it would be priced at. I would be amazed, you know, if my art had sold at, um, you know, for $10.\u201dThe sale of his work, however. appears to be cutting through as a media narrative in a way that lurid rightwing conspiracy theories never did. Just as President Jimmy Carter\u2019s younger brother marketed and sold \u201cBilly Beer\u201d in 1977, Hunter faces accusations that he is cashing in.Shaub, now a senior fellow at the Project on Government Oversight watchdog, commented: \u201cYou hear people trying to justify it by saying, \u2018Well, of course, he\u2019s famous, he\u2019s the president\u2019s son,\u2019 but that\u2019s the exact problem because he may not be in public office and there may be no laws that apply to him but he is a citizen whose father happens to be the leader of the country and so he has a patriotic duty to not run around trying to capitalise on that relationship.\u201cSure, he\u2019s not a criminal if he fails to comply with that duty, but he\u2019s not a patriot either. He\u2019s not a man who cares about a country that has just been through a four-year ethical nightmare. He sees an opportunity for profiteering and says, \u2018Well, you know, it\u2019s legal. I\u2019m just going to do it. Who cares what that does to my country?\u2019\u201dThe conflict-of-interest concerns cast a shadow over efforts by the president \u2013 who likes to vow \u201cmy word as a Biden\u201d \u2013 to show the world that America has turned the corner after the constant allegations that Trump\u2019s business and family benefited from his office, including the appointment of his daughter and son-in-law to senior White House positions.Hunter Biden embraces Jill and Joe Biden at the president\u2019s inauguration in Washington on 20 January. Photograph: AlamyBiden issued a memorandum establishing fighting corruption as a core national security interest. His administration responded to the Pandora Papers by promising to push for greater transparency in financial systems.It sought to pre-empt questions over Hunter\u2019s art by striking an agreement, first reported by the Washington Post in July, under which the gallery owner, Georges Berg\u00e8s, would set the prices of the art and not reveal who bid on or bought it, as well as rejecting offers that seemed extortionate.But there is no mechanism to monitor the agreement. Critics say Hunter\u2019s presence at the recent gallery event in Hollywood undercut claims that neither he nor the White House would know the identity of buyers. And Garcetti, who also attended, is Biden\u2019s nominee to be the next US ambassador to India and a former national co-chair of his 2020 presidential campaign.The issue was given short shrift this week by Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary.She told a reporter at the daily briefing: \u201cIt still is the purview of the gallerist. We still do not know and will not know who purchases any paintings. And the president remains proud of his son.\u201d When the reporter tried to follow up, Psaki interjected sharply: \u201cDid you have another question on something else?\u201dIt\u2019s really unfortunate that Hunter Biden has chosen to attempt to make money in a way that is vulnerable to influence peddlingKathleen ClarkShaub condemned her manner as \u201csurly\u201d and described the agreement to keep buyers anonymous as \u201can insult to our intelligence\u201d. He explained: \u201cAnybody who spends tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy art because it was created by the president\u2019s son is going to be very open and vocal about the fact that they bought it. It\u2019s going to be the showpiece at cocktail parties and so that information will eventually come out. This is a farce.\u201dSome commentators have argued that transparency would work better than secrecy, allowing the public to know whether a buyer such as a political lobbyist had paid a suspiciously high price. When the Guardian called the Georges Berg\u00e8s Gallery, it was told to send an email and did so, but did not receive a reply. When the Guardian called the Milk Studios, which hosted Hunter\u2019s show, a man twice answered and twice hung up.Ethics expert Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of Law, joined criticism of the arrangement. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that Hunter Biden has chosen to attempt to make money in a way that is vulnerable to influence peddling.\u201cNow, he\u2019s an adult and the ethics standards that bind elected officials and civil servants don\u2019t apply to him directly. On the other hand, not all forms of compensated work have this kind of vulnerability but this kind of work does because it\u2019s so difficult to know exactly what the value of a painting is.\u201dIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner watch as Donald Trump speaks at the Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, as he left office on 20 Januaary. \u2018\u201cBetter than Trump\u201d should never, ever, ever become the standard in this country.\u2019 Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/ReutersThe previous White House set a historically low bar, Clark added. \u201cThe Trump administration gave the impression that they were attempting to be unethical, like that was the goal, like they were seeking some kind of championship bid in unethical if not criminal conduct. It\u2019s nothing like that. But it still could be a disappointment when the Biden administration doesn\u2019t live up to what it might do in terms of transparency, for example.\u201dIndeed, the sheer breadth and depth of Trump scandals that captivated the media for four years might have partially shielded Biden and Hunter from sustained scrutiny. A recent book on the Biden family by the Politico journalist Ben Schreckinger presents evidence that some emails allegedly leaked from Hunter\u2019s laptop regarding business deals were genuine and not, as widely assumed, planted by Russian intelligence.Shaub suggested that many people are blinded to the ethical problem of the artwork for two reasons. \u201cOne is just the hyper-partisanship that has evolved in our country and so people who voted for Biden run around saying, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not as bad as Trump.\u2019\u201cOf course it\u2019s not even close to as bad as Trump but \u2018better than Trump\u2019 should never, ever, ever become the standard in this country because that\u2019s saying, \u2018I\u2019m better than the absolute worst that prior to 2016 you couldn\u2019t have even conceived of.\u2019\u201dThis is a man whose entire life has been is based off of making money on his father\u2019s political careerWalter ShaubHe continued: \u201cThe second thing that\u2019s blinding people is that there was a lot of unfair smearing of Hunter Biden by very well-funded political actors who were completely disingenuous in their ridiculous accusations. I guess that worked well with their base but it really clouded the issue because the truth is Hunter Biden is not the villain these political actors make him out to be.\u201cBut he\u2019s also not the upstanding citizen that the White House wants you to believe. This is a man whose entire life has been is based off of making money on his father\u2019s political career and that is not something we should embrace in this country and celebrate and tolerate. So two things can be true at the same time.\u201dUS allies around the world have been looking at the US for evidence that the country has stabilized in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s presidency, Shaub said. \u201cYeah, we have a new administration that isn\u2019t rampantly thumbing its nose at the rule of law, but it is going right up to the line and saying, if it\u2019s legal, we\u2019re going to do it and we\u2019re not going to focus on reforms, we\u2019re not going to focus on setting a squeaky clean tone, we\u2019re going to go back to the way things were before Trump.\u201d",

"author": "Jason Lange", "date": "October 15, 2021, 9:38 PM", "body": "By Jason LangeWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four candidates backed by Donald Trump to challenge Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach him or boot him from office are falling behind in raising money for their campaigns, according to disclosures filed on Friday.Trump, who left office in January, remains a major influence within the Republican party, which hopes to regain control of the U.S. Congress in next year's elections.Only a handful of Republicans joined Democrats when Congress voted to impeach Trump and then held an unsuccessful vote in the Senate to remove him from office, on a charge he incited insurrectionists to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.Trump has called the Republicans who crossed him \"disloyal\" or \"losers,\" and they have faced scorn within their party. Several have said they will retire or not seek re-election.But those who are facing Trump-backed candidates in upcoming party nomination contests so far have raised more money than their challengers, which might help them counter Trump's campaign against them.U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump in the Senate, raised $1.1 million between July and September, more than the twice the $466,000 raised by her Republican challenger Kelly Tshibaka, a former state administration commissioner endorsed by Trump.Murkowski - who ended September with $3.2 million in the bank, more than 10 times what Tshibaka had - raked in money from corporate-run donor committees, according to a disclosure Murkowski filed with the Federal Election Commission.Murkowski also raised more than $75,000 through a joint fundraising effort with several senators endorsed by Trump, including Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who voted against convicting Trump.Raising more money by no means guarantees victory, but it can help candidates buy expensive television advertisements and pay campaign staff.Story continuesRepresentative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who is widely seen in great peril of losing her seat because of her vote to impeach Trump and her vocal criticism of the former president, raised $1.7 million during the three-month period.Her Trump-endorsed opponent, attorney Harriet Hageman, entered the race in early September and raised about $300,000, or roughly $100,000 a week, shy of Cheney's fundraising pace.Cheney, the highest-profile lawmaker of the 10 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to impeach Trump, drew donations from a number of Wall Street executives, including Blackstone Chief Investment Officer Prakash Melwani. Hageman received a donation from billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Trump has also endorsed opponents to U.S. Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who both voted to impeach him.Upton raised $293,000 between July and September, more than the twice the $116,000 raised by his Trump-endorsed challenger, state lawmaker Steve Carra.Herrera Beutler not only voted to impeach Trump, she submitted evidence in his Senate trial against the former president. She took in $524,000 during the period, outraising Trump-backed Army veteran Joe Kent, who raised $452,000.Trump also endorsed his former White House aide Max Miller to challenge U.S. Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who said in September he would not seek re-election. Miller's disclosure filed on Friday showed his campaign raised $695,000, most of which came from a half-million-dollar contribution he made to his own campaign.(Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "preprocessed": "jason langewashington reuter four candid back donald trump challeng republican lawmak vote impeach boot offic fall behind rais money campaign accord disclosur file friday trump left offic januari remain major influenc within republican parti hope regain control u congress next year elect hand republican join democrat congress vote impeach trump held unsuccess vote senat remov offic charg incit insurrectionist attack u capitol jan trump call republican cross disloy loser face scorn within parti sever said retir seek elect face trump back candid upcom parti nomin contest far rais money challeng might help counter trump campaign u senat lisa murkowski alaska moder one seven republican vote convict trump senat rais million juli septemb twice rais republican challeng kelli tshibaka former state administr commission endors trump murkowski end septemb million bank time tshibaka rake money corpor run donor committe accord disclosur murkowski file feder elect commiss murkowski also rais joint fundrais effort sever senat endors trump includ senat chuck grassley iowa vote convict trump rais money mean guarante victori help candid buy expens televis advertis pay campaign staff stori continuesrepres liz cheney wyom wide seen great peril lose seat vote impeach trump vocal critic former presid rais million three month period trump endors oppon attorney harriet hageman enter race earli septemb rais roughli week shi cheney fundrais pace cheney highest profil lawmak republican hous repres vote impeach trump drew donat number wall street execut includ blackston chief invest offic prakash melwani hageman receiv donat billionair ventur capitalist peter thiel trump also endors oppon u repres fred upton michigan jaim herrera beutler washington state vote impeach upton rais juli septemb twice rais trump endors challeng state lawmak steve carra herrera beutler vote impeach trump submit evid senat trial former presid took period outrais trump back armi veteran joe kent rais trump also endors former white hous aid max miller challeng u repres anthoni gonzalez ohio said septemb would seek elect miller disclosur file friday show campaign rais came half million dollar contribut made campaign report jason lang edit lesli adler"}, {"title": "Drain the swamp? This guy's trying to fill it.", "author": "Hailey Fuchs", "date": "October 15, 2021, 4:30 AM", "body": "Ivan Adler is nothing if not self-aware. Sitting down at an Irish gastro pub located just a few miles outside Washington, D.C.\u2019s confines, he wore a black and white T-shirt that got straight to the point:\u201clob\u2022by\u2022ist[lob-ee-ist]-nouna friend with benefits.\u201dAdler, 56, is not in fact a lobbyist. But his job shares some key similarities. He is a recruiter \u2014 one of the top in D.C. \u2014 who specializes in plucking lawmakers and staffers off the Hill or elsewhere in government and placing them into jobs on K Street, whether it be trade associations, corporations, law practices or lobbying firms.The president of the boutique shop Ivan Adler Associates, he calls himself \u201cThe Lobbyist Hunter.\u201d His eponymous firm specializes in matching government relations and public affairs professionals with gigs on \u201cK Street....and beyond.\u201d His task is to convince the idealists who descended on the nation\u2019s capital to become public servants that the lifestyle of influence peddling is more laid back and certainly more lucrative. He maintains that \u201cnobody has a gun to their head,\u201d but he is, effectively, the doorman for the revolving door.\u201cGuilty as charged,\u201d he told POLITICO over lunch at one of his regular haunts, having warned that his voice may be a bit \u201cgrowly\u201d due to the Red Sox and Patriots games the weekend prior. Like most things with Adler, there was little formality, even for a profile piece. He showed up dressed as if he was meeting an old friend, donning a pair of cargo shorts and a cap with his own name on it.\u201cSomebody\u2019s gotta do it. It might as well be me,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to laugh when I walk into, like, the bar in Capital Grille, and there were people that know me and are working with me to find a job that, like, don\u2019t wave at me or talk to me when I\u2019m there because they don\u2019t want other people there to know that they\u2019re looking.\u201d\u201cI love it, it\u2019s great,\u201d Adler added. \u201cI get a huge kick out of it.\u201dThere are other lobbyist recruiters in Washington, but few if any do it with as much bravado as Adler. His name is well-known among lawmakers who are leaving their posts on the Hill for jobs in the private sector. He\u2019s a regular at the city\u2019s cocktail circuit, where he knows how to work a room. He\u2019s so plugged in, he says, that he is sometimes among the first to know a member of Congress is contemplating whether or not to seek reelection.Story continues\u201cHe\u2019s part of the swamp, right? He\u2019s part of the, he\u2019s part of the crew,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, a partner and lobbyist at Hogan Lovells. He called Adler a personal \u201ccareer rabbi\u201d who helped him land at his current firm. The two used to grab lunches at the Palm while Zapien was a Democratic Hill staffer, and chat about his potential exit. Adler, he maintained, does not convince people to leave the Hill; rather, he \u201cfacilitates\u201d their departure.Adler claims to be well compensated for this work, though it\u2019s tough to tell. With about six or so hires each year, Adler says he makes a usual rate of 25 percent of the job candidate\u2019s annual salary (paid by the hiring organization). Beyond his schlubby appearance, his modest two-bedroom apartment suggests he lives a lifestyle more akin to the Hill aides he tries to lure to K Street than a K Street denizen himself. There was, what appeared to be, a lone red solo cup on his coffee table and some flowers in a Tito\u2019s handle on his countertop, beside a sign that reads: \u201cAlcohol because no great story ever started with someone eating a salad.\u201dIt can be difficult at times to figure out where the projection ends and the reality begins. Adler is a perpetual name dropper. He referred to Sheldon Adelson, the deceased Republican mega-donor, as \u201cShelly,\u201d and boasted of a client list that includes dozens members of Congress. And yet, lawmakers who responded to requests for comment from POLITICO did confirm many of his assertions. The list of congressional alums whom he has advised or placed at firms include former Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and former Reps. Albert Wynn (D-Md.) and James T. Walsh (R-N.Y.), among others.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that stay 20 years, and they retire. My argument is, what are these people supposed to do?\u201d Adler asked. \u201cDo you expect them to go and do something, do you want to force them to do something else? I mean that\u2019s just what, it\u2019s just their job. That\u2019s how I think about it. I don\u2019t look at it as unethical.\u201dAll of this makes Adler a rather unique Washington character. At a time when most people shun the This Town persona, he plays it up. He is an unapologetic purveyor of the revolving door between the Hill and K Street, itself among the most controversial but everlasting elements of Washington\u2019s dark underbelly. To many observers, it\u2019s everything that\u2019s wrong with politics: a constant flow of personnel from posts where they make laws to ones where they try to change or take advantage of the laws they helped craft. But to Adler, it\u2019s been a woefully misunderstood opportunity.He argues that staffers in the public sector are often overworked; that they leave their jobs because of burnout and find solace at higher-paying gigs on K Street. And, to a degree, political leaders agree with his assessment. They just have different solutions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced this past summer that House aides could now make as much as $199,300 per year \u2014 potentially more than some lawmakers \u2014 in an effort to combat the brain drain.For Jeff Hauser, director of The Revolving Door Project, a group that works to combat corporate special interests, Adler isn\u2019t the problem, he\u2019s a \u201csymptom\u201d of it. Noting that former congressional staffers are hardly social pariahs to their former colleagues when they leave the Hill for lobbying gigs, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that there will be people helping \u2014 unabashedly helping \u2014 people revolve out of congressional service and into corporate service.\u201dAdler grew up in a Kosher household in Winchester, Mass. to a mother who worked as a teacher and a father who sold paper products. As a student at George Washington University, he dreamed of working on the Hill. And after a brief stint working for the Tennessee Valley Authority, he got a gig driving then-Sen. Al Gore\u2019s car while the Tennessee Democrat ran for president in the late '80s.When Gore lost and the staffer whom he had briefly replaced returned from the campaign trail, Adler was out of a job. He no longer wanted to work in government, citing the long hours and tough work. Instead, he landed a gig at PR Newswire, a press release distribution service, but grew tired of the job. A fraternity brother suggested he look into a headhunting firm, where he went on to work on the technology team (Adler repeatedly claimed that he was the best employee in the country or company at these jobs).\u201cPeople were just a bunch of geeks,\u201d he said of the software engineers and tech professionals he helped recruit.While he toiled away, his then-wife had an altogether different existence. She was a lobbyist at the time for the Distilled Spirits Council, meaning that, among other things, she had access to quality booze. Meetings there included a full bar with \u201ctop shelf stuff,\u201d as Adler recalled. Naturally, he wanted in.So Adler began recruiting lobbyists at The McCormick Group, an Arlington-based staffing and recruiting firm. Like his wife\u2019s colleagues at the Distilled Spirits Council, those guys were far more fun than the nerdy tech professionals. Including his time as a tech recruiter, he stayed there for 23 years before starting his own shop in 2019.The first year, with a burgeoning pandemic, was tough. He brought in very little at the start, Adler said. In fact, his accountant told him he needed to borrow money from his 401K. Now, it\u2019s largely back to business as usual, he insisted.Over time, he developed a method for luring staff on the Hill to the Dark Side. He\u2019d call a Hill staffer at their direct line and pitch them on the private sector job. There was no need to play up the salary, Adler said, because everyone understood it would be a raise. Sometimes, the staffer wasn\u2019t interested. In those cases, he\u2019d gather information on what it would take for them to leave and names of other staffers to target. Other times, the staffer would ask to exchange cell phone numbers so that the two could speak that night, outside the ear shot of colleagues.If they say, \u201cCan you hang on a second, I want to close my door,\u201d or \u201cCan I call you back from my cell phone,\u201d you know they\u2019re interested, said John Hesse, Adler\u2019s longtime associate and self-described apprentice.Those were the small fish. For lawmakers, the process is a bit different. Wynn, the former Maryland representative, was introduced to Adler through his chief of staff after he lost the 2008 primary, he said. Adler served as an adviser of sorts to Wynn as he navigated where he would land next. The congressman ultimately resigned during the lame duck period, prompting a special election, and signed with the firm Dickstein Shapiro (he was connected through an old law school classmate, he said, although Adler maintains that he was still paid).Jones, the Alabama Democrat who lost to Republican Tommy Tuberville in the 2020 election, got connected with Adler through a mutual friend. The two did not begin talks until after he left office, Jones said, once he had a better idea of what he wanted to do with his professional life after the Senate and once he realized that a position in the Biden administration \u2014 namely attorney general \u2014 would not materialize.The former senator had some \u201cunique limitations\u201d that he declined to explain when it comes to the kind of lobbying that he would do. He spoke with a few different headhunters but settled on Adler, citing a level of comfort and a gut reaction that he could not quite describe.As Jones\u2019 anecdote highlights, it\u2019s not exactly clear what draws Washington insiders to Adler. Walsh, the New York Republican, and Bart Stupak, a former Democratic congressman from Michigan, both said they have recommended Adler to other members of Congress. Walsh also noted that Adler advised him on compensation.He also works the firms directly. Lobbyists from K&L Gates, Holland & Knight and Hogan Lovells confirmed that they had consulted with Adler on searches or potential hires.He views his profession as a philosophical calling, describing lobbying as a \u201cprotected\u201d form of speech that fell firmly under the First Amendment. But like the Hill aides he courts, it\u2019s the promise of being part of the fabric of Washington\u2019s intrigue and the shoulder-rubbing of elites that entices him too. Part of the fun of the job is hoarding the secrets of K Street insiders, he said, like when someone is fired for a moment of drunken stupor. The draw, in part, of the kind of work he does is the gossip. That seems to be a throughline for Adler: he always wants to be in the know.His email signature: \u201cEverything good in life begins with a conversation.\u201d", "preprocessed": "ivan adler noth self

resignation, from elected officials and various human rights groups over his recent discriminatory comments that likened gay and transgender people to \u201cfilth\u201d.Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, the state\u2019s highest Republican in an executive office position, made the remarks at Asbury Baptist church in Seagrove, North Carolina, in June. Right Wing Watch, a project of the advocacy group People For the American Way, posted the video on social media last week.In the video, Robinson can be heard saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth \u2026 And yes, I called it filth, and if you don\u2019t like that I called it filth, come see me and I\u2019ll explain it to you.\u201dAndrew Bates, a White House deputy press secretary from North Carolina, condemned Robinson\u2019s remarks, saying, \u201cThese words are repugnant and offensive. The role of a leader is to bring people together and stand up for the dignity and rights of everyone; not to spread hate and undermine their own office.\u201dIn addition to the White House, Democratic lawmakers and numerous rights groups have criticized Robinson, with some demanding his resignation while others request to meet him to discuss his remarks.Jeff Jackson, a Democratic state senator and US Senate candidate urged Robinson to quit, tweeting, \u201cCalling many of your own constituents \u2018filth\u2019 means you have no intention of representing them. Our Lt Governor should resign and allow someone who is prepared to do the job to take his place. This wasn\u2019t a dog whistle, folks. This was old school hate.\u201dThis is not the first time Robinson has shared his discriminatory views, but it should be the last time he gets away with itHuman Rights CampaignThe Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, released a statement saying: \u201cWe are calling on Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson to resign for his disgraceful, hateful statements \u2026 This is not the first time Robinson has shared his discriminatory views, but it should be the last time he gets away with it as an elected leader.\u201dStory continuesKaye Vassey, a spokesperson from the LGBT Center of Raleigh echoed the HRC\u2019s sentiments, telling the Guardian, \u201cI\u2019m not going down a path of politics but just absolute human rights and the words that he spoke are dangerous to the LGBTQ community, especially to the youth \u2026 and it\u2019s a travesty.\u201d\u201cWe did send an open letter saying we would like to set up that meeting and ask for his resignation,\u201d Vassey added, referring to an open letter sent by St John\u2019s Metropolitan Community Church on behalf of various church groups to Robinson.\u201cYour words have caused considerable harm and you have the potential to cost people their lives. The Trevor Projects estimates that at least one LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13-24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds in the US. This number could be reduced by as much as 40% if an adult in these young people\u2019s lives shares unconditional love with them,\u201d the letter obtained by the Guardian read.Alisson Scott, director of impact and innovation at Campaign for Southern Equality, told the Guardian, \u201cWhen he makes these comments, he somehow \u2026 tries to roll with the assumption that there are no LGBTQ students in existence and that we\u2019re all somehow just adults and that\u2019s simply false \u2026 For him to say this, it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s a weapon.\u201dRobinson, who has since doubled down on his comments, remained defiant, even posting on Facebook that he will not back down nor be silenced. He also said he would continue to fight for the rights of children to receive an education free from sexual concepts that \u201cdo not belong in the classroom\u201d.According to Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow at People For the American Way, Robinson\u2019s act of defiance is \u201ca sign that he is counting on rallying up and motivating the right wing base to carry him over the finish line.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s his political strategy \u2013 to use this kind of rhetoric to portray himself as the victim. He\u2019s happy to hurl himself at others but somehow people criticizing him for making bigoted comments prompts him to make him seem like the victim,\u201d Montgomery told the Guardian.Robinson\u2019s recent comments are only the latest examples of his discrimination against the LGBTQ community. After the 2016 shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Robinson wrote, \u201cI pray for the souls of all those killed \u2026 However, homosexuality is STILL an abominable sin.\u201dIn 2019, Robinson accused parents of having \u201cmentally raped\u201d their transgender children while criticizing gender reassignment surgeries.", "preprocessed": "photograph bryan anderson apa top republican politician north carolina face wave outrag backlash includ call resign elect offici variou human right group recent discriminatori comment liken gay transgend peopl filth lieuten governor mark robinson state highest republican execut offic posit made remark asburi baptist church seagrov north carolina june right wing watch project advocaci group peopl american way post video social medium last week video robinson heard say reason anybodi anywher america tell child transgender homosexu filth ye call filth like call filth come see explain andrew bate white hous deputi press secretari north carolina condemn robinson remark say word repugn offens role leader bring peopl togeth stand digniti right everyon spread hate undermin offic addit white hous democrat lawmak numer right group critic robinson demand resign other request meet discus remark jeff jackson democrat state senat u senat candid urg robinson quit tweet call mani constitu filth mean intent repres lt governor resign allow someon prepar job take place dog whistl folk old school hate first time robinson share discriminatori view last time get away ithuman right campaignth human right campaign nation largest lgbtq civil right organ releas statement say call lieuten governor mark robinson resign disgrac hate statement first time robinson share discriminatori view last time get away elect leader stori continueskay vassey spokesperson lgbt center raleigh echo hrc sentiment tell guardian go path polit absolut human right word spoke danger lgbtq commun especi youth travesti send open letter say would like set meet ask resign vassey ad refer open letter sent st john metropolitan commun church behalf variou church group robinson word caus consider harm potenti cost peopl live trevor project estim least one lgbtq youth age attempt suicid everi second u number could reduc much adult young peopl live share uncondit love letter obtain guardian read alisson scott director impact innov campaign southern equal told guardian make comment somehow tri roll assumpt lgbtq student exist somehow adult simpli fals say danger weapon robinson sinc doubl comment remain defiant even post facebook back silenc also said would continu fight right child receiv educ free sexual concept belong classroom accord peter montgomeri senior fellow peopl american way robinson act defianc sign count ralli motiv right wing base carri finish line think polit strategi use kind rhetor portray victim happi hurl other somehow peopl critic make bigot comment prompt make seem like victim montgomeri told guardian robinson recent comment latest exampl discrimin lgbtq commun shoot pul gay nightclub orlando florida robinson wrote pray soul kill howev homosexu still abomin sin robinson accus parent mental rape transgend child critic gender reassign surgeri"}, {"title": "'Because of you democracy survived': Biden pays tribute to police during memorial ceremony", "author": "Sarah Elbeshbishi, USA TODAY", "date": "October 16, 2021, 2:27 PM", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Joe Biden praised law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol during the attack on Jan. 6 in remarks Saturday at the National Peace Officers\u2019 annual memorial service.Biden said the officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and Washington, D.C.

As Reuters reported, the event took place Saturday on the steps of the US Capitol. Other attendees included FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and first lady Jill Biden, according to the report.\"I've spoken to too many police memorials around the country,\" Biden said Saturday. \"And it always amazes me how the public doesn't fully understand what we expect of our law enforcement officers.\"\"Being a cop today is one hell of a lot harder than it's ever been,\" Biden said during his remarks, which lasted 22 minutes, per Reuters.Biden ordered flags flown at half staff ahead of the memorial Saturday. The event was held to honor the 491 law enforcement officers who died while working in 2019 and 2020, according to Reuters.During his speech, Biden said law enforcement worked to uphold the US political system during the January 6 riot at the US capitol when a pro-Trump mob breached the building while lawmakers were meeting to certify the results of the 2020 election.He also called attention to the one police officer who was killed and the two others who were wounded in a shooting early Saturday outside a bar in Houston.\"We expect you to be people ready to stand in the way and take a bullet for us.

We give in a bipartisan, transparent manner as our voluntary disclosures demonstrate and will continue to do so,\u201d Dominion spokesperson Rayhan Daudani said in an emailed statement.Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter called Dominion's donation an effort by McAuliffe and Virginia Democrats to \"call in their special interest cronies to dump obscene amounts of money into shadowy organizations in order to protect their entrenched interests.\"A McAuliffe campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Why it matters: Dominion's support for Accountability Virginia provides an avenue for the utility, historically one of the state's largest political donors, to back McAuliffe's candidacy even as the former governor himself refuses its financial support.McAuliffe has said from the outset of the 2021 race that he would not accept Dominion contributions, a pledge he also made during his unsuccessful 2009 gubernatorial run.During his successful 2013 bid, though, Dominion donated $75,000 to McAuliffe's campaign and another $50,000 to his inaugural committee.Hala Ayala, the Democratic nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor, also swore off Dominion support this year, but later accepted six-figure sums from the company. \"People change their minds all the time,\" she said of the shift.Between the lines: Accountability Virginia PAC's messaging and tactics have nothing to do with energy or environmental policy, or even the general business climate in the state.Instead, the group has run social media ads questioning Youngkin's commitment to gun rights.The ads have largely targeted western Virginia, where Republicans are most heavily concentrated.Despite hitting Youngkin from the right, all indications point to Democrats being behind the group.Like this article?

Dorman", "date": "October 16, 2021, 1:55 PM", "body": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesGov. Ron DeSantis has pledged to fight the Biden administration over federal vaccine mandates.\"I am offended that a police officer could potentially lose their job,\" he said on Thursday.DeSantis has opposed broad vaccine requirements and mask mandates in K-12 public schools.Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a vocal opponent of COVID-19 vaccine mandates, on Thursday said that the state will fight the federal government in court over legislation regarding such requirements.DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has spoken out forcefully against vaccination rules placed on employers, and last month said that President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate was a violation of Florida law.\"Let's not have Biden come in and effectively take away - threaten to take away - the jobs of people who have been working hard throughout this entire pandemic,\" DeSantis said during a news conference this week. \"I am offended that a police officer could potentially lose their job.\"\"I just think it's fundamentally wrong to be taking people's jobs away, particularly given the situations that we see ourselves facing with the economy,\" he added.The rule from the federal government mandates that employers with over 100 workers must require vaccination or conduct weekly testing, which would affect about 80 million Americans. The broader mandate would also affect about 17 million healthcare workers who are employed by hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, along with federal employees and contractors.Republicans last month quickly pounced on Biden's move.Even Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has traveled throughout his conservative in an effort to boost the vaccine, said that Biden's decision to enact a federal mandate was not helpful to increasing inoculation levels among the public.\"I support businesses being able to require vaccination, but it's their own independent choice for their workplace,\" he said last month. \"But to have the federal mandate will be counterproductive. It's going to increase resistance. We're going to grow our vaccinations whether you have this or not.\"Story continuesDeSantis, who has rejected the use of vaccine passports and waged battles with school districts that have sought to implement mask mandates, recently appointed Dr. Joseph Ladapo to become the state's new surgeon general.Ladapo, who opposes mask mandates and feels that COVID-19 vaccines are \"nothing special,\" last year boosted the use of the drug hydroxychloroquine to fight the coronavirus. The World Health Organization earlier this year said that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective form of treatment for COVID-19.Recently, the Florida Department of Health leveled a $3.57 million fine against Leon County, which encompasses the state capital of Tallahassee, after the jurisdiction mandated that hundreds of workers receive the vaccine.The county terminated the employment of 14 workers who chose not to receive the vaccine, according to The Tallahassee Democrat, and local officials are prepared to defend the requirement in court.A recent study conducted by the French government-backed scientific organization Epi-Phare, which looked at nearly 23 million individuals, found that vaccines reduced the risk of contracting a severe case of COVID-19 by at least 90% among individuals 50 years old or older.As Insider's Eliza Relman previously reported, medical professionals as well as public health and legal experts, have praised vaccine and testing mandates as effective and constitutional tools to promote public health -- especially as the unvaccinated pose a threat to others' health and safety.DeSantis said that the state's lawsuits against the federal mandates will be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.Florida, which this past summer experienced a surge in new COVID-19 infections fueled by the highly infectious Delta variant, has seen over 57,000 of its residents succumb to the virus since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Read the original article on Business Insider", "preprocessed": "gov ron desanti florida paul hennessi sopa imag lightrocket via getti imagesgov ron desanti pledg fight biden administr feder vaccin mandat offend polic offic could potenti lose job said thursday desanti oppos broad vaccin requir mask mandat k public school republican gov ron desanti florida vocal oppon covid vaccin mandat thursday said state fight feder govern court legisl regard requir desanti potenti presidenti candid spoken forc vaccin rule place employ last month said presid joe biden vaccin mandat violat florida law let biden come effect take away threaten take away job peopl work hard throughout entir pandem desanti said news confer week offend polic offic could potenti lose job think fundament wrong take peopl job away particularli given situat see face economi ad rule feder govern mandat employ worker must requir vaccin conduct weekli test would affect million american broader mandat would also affect million healthcar worker employ hospit accept medicar medicaid reimburs along feder employe contractor republican last month quickli pounc biden move even gov asa hutchinson arkansa travel throughout conserv effort boost vaccin said biden decis enact feder mandat help increas inocul level among public support busi abl requir vaccin independ choic workplac said last month feder mandat counterproduct go increas resist go grow vaccin whether stori continuesdesanti reject use vaccin passport wage battl school district sought implement mask mandat recent appoint dr joseph ladapo becom state new surgeon gener ladapo oppos mask mandat feel covid vaccin noth special last year boost use drug hydroxychloroquin fight coronaviru world health organ earlier year said hydroxychloroquin effect form treatment covid recent florida depart health level million fine leon counti encompass state capit tallahasse jurisdict mandat hundr worker receiv vaccin counti termin employ worker chose receiv vaccin accord tallahasse democrat local offici prepar defend requir court recent studi conduct french govern back scientif organ epi phare look nearli million individu found vaccin reduc risk contract sever case covid least among individu year old older insid eliza relman previous report medic profession well public health legal expert prais vaccin test mandat effect constitut tool promot public health especi unvaccin pose threat other health safeti desanti said state lawsuit feder mandat file unit state court appeal eleventh circuit florida past summer experienc surg new covid infect fuel highli infecti delta variant seen resid succumb viru sinc begin pandem accord latest data compil john hopkin univers read origin articl busi insid"}, {"title": "Donald Trump-backed challengers to Republican lawmakers are lagging in the battle to fill their fundraising war chests", "author": "Alia Shoaib", "date": "October 16, 2021, 11:03 AM", "body": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski (L), Former President Donald Trump (R). Pool/Getty ImagesDonald Trump has backed challengers to Republican lawmakers who voted for his impeachment or conviction.Four Trump-backed challengers are trailing behind opponents in fundraising, according to recently filed disclosures.Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Rep. Liz Cheney are two Republicans that Trump is targeting.Candidates backed by former President Donald Trump to challenge Republican lawmakers are lagging in fundraising, Reuters reported, according to disclosures filed on Friday.Following Trump's second impeachment, he vowed to help oust \"disloyal\" Republicans who voted against him.Out of the seven Republican senators that voted to convict Trump following his impeachment over the Capitol riot, only one is up for election in 2022, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.Trump previously vowed to campaign for anyone who challenged Murkowski.\"Get any candidate ready, good or bad. I don't care. I'm endorsing. If you have a pulse, I'm with you!\" Trump said.He eventually endorsed former state administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka.The recent filings showed that Murkowski had raised $1.1 million between July and September, more than double the $466,000 raised by Tshibaka.Indeed, Murkowski is yet to announce her candidacy for re-election formally.Overall, Murkowski has raised over $3.2 million and is doing well with corporate-run donor committees, Reuters said, citing the recent filings.The Alaskan senator raised more than $75,000 through a joint fundraising effort with several senators endorsed by Trump, including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.Another high-profile Republican lawmaker who has been at odds with Trump is Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of the 10 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to impeach him.On January 6, Trump reportedly said in a speech to supporters that he vowed to get rid of \"the Liz Cheneys of the world.\"Cheney, a vocal critic of the former president, was ousted from a leadership role within the GOP after criticizing the party for promoting lies about the 2020 election being fraudulent.Story continuesTrump endorsed former RNC official Harriet Hageman to run against Cheney, despite revelations that the candidate had once called him \"racist and xenophobic.\"Despite her precarious role within her party, recent filings show that Cheney has raised $1.7 million during a three-month period, compared with the $300,000 raised by Hageman, Reuters said.Cheney received donations from several Wall Street executives, including Blackstone Chief Investment Officer Prakash Melwani, the outlet reported.Meanwhile, Hageman received a donation from the controversial billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.Trump has also endorsed challengers to two other Representatives who voted to impeach him; Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state and Fred Upton of Michigan.Herrera Beutler raised $524,000 between July and September, compared with $452,000 raised by her Trump-backed challenger Joe Kent, Reuters said.Meanwhile, Upton raised $293,000, more than twice the $116,000 raised by the Trump-backed candidate Steve Carra.Although fundraising more money does not necessarily assure victory, it can help increase exposure through advertising.For House seats, typically more than 90 percent of candidates who spend the most win, according to Five Thirty Eight, citing the Center for Responsive Politics.However, the outlet adds that it's not necessarily the money that delivers victory but rather that a winning candidate is more likely to attract funds.Read the original article on Business Insider", "preprocessed": "sen lisa murkowski l former presid donald trump r pool getti imagesdonald trump back challeng republican lawmak vote impeach convict four trump back challeng trail behind oppon fundrais accord recent file disclosur sen lisa murkowski rep liz cheney two republican trump target candid back former presid donald trump challeng republican lawmak lag fundrais reuter report accord disclosur file friday follow trump second impeach vow help oust disloy republican vote seven republican senat vote convict trump follow impeach capitol riot one elect sen lisa murkowski alaska trump previous vow campaign anyon challeng murkowski get candid readi good bad care endors pul trump said eventu endors former state administr commission kelli tshibaka recent file show murkowski rais million juli septemb doubl rais tshibaka inde murkowski yet announc candidaci elect formal overal murkowski rais million well corpor run donor committe reuter said cite recent file alaskan senat rais joint fundrais effort sever senat endors trump includ sen chuck grassley iowa anoth high profil republican lawmak odd trump rep liz cheney wyom one republican hous repres vote impeach januari trump reportedli said speech support vow get rid liz cheney world cheney vocal critic former presid oust leadership role within gop critic parti promot lie elect fraudul stori continuestrump endors former rnc offici harriet hageman run cheney despit revel candid call racist xenophob despit precari role within parti recent file show cheney rais million three month period compar rais hageman reuter said cheney receiv donat sever wall street execut includ blackston chief invest offic prakash melwani outlet report meanwhil hageman receiv donat controversi billionair ventur capitalist peter thiel trump also endors challeng two repres vote impeach jaim herrera beutler washington state fred upton michigan herrera beutler rais juli septemb compar rais trump back challeng joe kent reuter said meanwhil upton rais twice rais trump back candid steve carra although fundrais money necessarili assur victori help increas exposur advertis hous seat typic percent candid spend win accord five thirti eight cite center respons polit howev outlet add necessarili money deliv victori rather win candid like attract fund read origin articl busi insid"}, {"title": "Week 7's best college football games: No. 11 Kentucky gets a shot at No. 1 Georgia", "author": "Eddie Timanus, USA TODAY", "date": "October 16, 2021, 7:17 AM", "body": "College football has a hard act to follow after last Saturday\u2019s wild ride. But this sport rarely lacks for weekly drama, so there should again be plenty of action worth watching.The Week 7 slate features just one top-25 meeting, but there are several other matchups with high entertainment potential. Those include a late-night contest out West that could determine a major conference division race, a big test in the Big 12 and an independent hoping to get off the deck. In all, we submit six games for your approval, though we\u2019re sure there will be others that will grab the spotlight for stretches on Saturday.No. 11 Kentucky at No. 1 Georgia3:30 p.m. ET, CBSWhy watch: The weekend headliner pits the Bulldogs, defending their newly acquired No. 1 ranking, against the upstart Wildcats in a huge showdown that in all likelihood will determine the SEC East championship. UK already owns a head-to-head win against Florida, and an upset here between the hedges would all but punch its ticket to the conference finale.Georgia meets the Gators in a few weeks, but a win here would in effect put the Bulldogs two games clear of the field. The Kentucky offense isn\u2019t flashy, but QB Will Levis is averaging 8.4 yards per passing attempt, enough to keep the running lanes open for RB Chris Rodriguez. Few have managed to do that, however, against the Bulldogs\u2019 top-ranked defense that surrenders just 203.5 yards a game. But the Wildcats have a top-20 defense themselves and have a good chance to keep it close. Georgia QB J.T. Daniels remains week-to-week with a back muscle injury, but Stetson Bennett has handled the Bulldogs\u2019 attack quite capably in his absence.Why it could disappoint: Bearing the above in mind, if UK is able to make a game of it, a low-scoring slog could be on tap. Auburn did manage to find the end zone once against the Bulldogs last week, but the Wildcats will nevertheless find it difficult to sustain drives. A multiple-possession lead for Georgia might prove insurmountable.Story continuesNo. 1 Georgia should get a test against No. 11 Kentucky on Saturday.No. 22 Arizona State at Utah10 p.m. ET, ESPNWhy watch: This Pac-12 nightcap is for the outright lead in the South Division, and though half the season remains, the winner will be difficult to overtake the rest of the way. The Utes still have a crossover date with Oregon on their slate but have a chance to get to 4-0 in league play (their two losses were out of conference).The Sun Devils have a more manageable schedule going forward but need to get past this major road test. ASU QB Jayden Daniels has shown superb command of the Sun Devils\u2019 offense in their last two wins against UCLA and Stanford. QB Cameron Rising and the ground defense for Utah were just as impressive in last week\u2019s win at Southern California, the Utes\u2019 first-ever victory against the Trojans in the L.A. Coliseum.Why it could disappoint: The Sun Devils\u2019 last visit to the Beehive State didn\u2019t go well in an error-filled loss to BYU. But they\u2019ve eliminated the mistakes of late, and if they continue to play sound football, the Utes could have trouble answering scores. It\u2019s #Pac12AfterDark though, so anything can happen.No. 12 Oklahoma State at TexasNoon ET, FoxWhy watch: The Longhorns don\u2019t get much time to lick their wounds after failing to close the deal against Red River rival Oklahoma. They head home to take on the rested and still unbeaten Cowboys, who could be eyeing an epic showdown of their own with the Sooners when Bedlam comes around at season\u2019s end.Both teams will want to start quickly. The Texas backfield tandem of QB Casey Thompson and RB Bijan Robinson looked unstoppable in the first half last week in Dallas but couldn\u2019t get anything going after intermission. The Oklahoma State offense, triggered by veteran QB Spencer Sanders and featuring WR Tay Martin, has experienced similarly inexplicable second-half struggles all season.Why it could disappoint: A blowout either way seems unlikely, but the Texas ground defense has been the primary culprit in the team\u2019s two losses. That\u2019s where Cowboys RB Jaylen Warren comes in. A big day from him could allow the Cowboys to pull away.No. 5 Alabama at Mississippi State7 p.m. ET, ESPNWhy watch: We come now to a test for the non-existent law of college football transitivity. The Crimson Tide, coming off an almost unheard of loss to an unranked opponent, hit the road again to meet the Bulldogs, who visited Texas A&M themselves just a week earlier and came away victorious. It isn\u2019t as if the Crimson Tide were bad in their two true road games. But they were not dominant as fans have come to expect from Alabama teams.They escaped Gainesville but were not so fortunate in College Station, with the defense in particular looking surprisingly vulnerable. Bulldogs QB Will Rogers has a healthy 75.7 completion percentage in the pass-heavy system that could pose a challenge. Tide QB Bryce Young and Co. will try to set the tone early to silence the cowbells in Starkville.Why it could disappoint: Notwithstanding the occasional big run, the Crimson Tide\u2019s ground game has been inconsistent some weeks, including the Texas A&M setback. One can assume there was \u2013 ahem \u2013 a degree of emphasis on that in practice this week. The Bulldogs\u2019 defense has been quite good, particularly in the secondary, but they could be in for a long night if the Tide is able to impose its will as it did against Mississippi.No. 14 Mississippi at Tennessee7:30 p.m. ET, SEC NetworkWhy watch: And, speaking of Ole Miss, we have to mention this Lane Kiffin return to Knoxville. Yes, we know we\u2019re spending a lot of time in the SEC this week. (Fret not, Big Ten fans. Your days are coming.) But games involving the Rebels are often appointment TV anyway, and the \u2013 erm \u2013 history with Tennessee adds another level of intrigue.As far as on-field matters are concerned, we should be in for another track meet. Ole Miss is putting up 46.2 points a game, with the Volunteers not far behind at 41.5. Hendon Hooker has added a different dimension to the Tennessee ground game since taking over at QB, with RB Tiyon Evans also reaping benefits.Why it could disappoint: A significant chunk of Tennessee's stats, however, came in its two most recent outings against Missouri and South Carolina. The Rebels\u2019 defense can spring leaks as well, but the last high-end QB to visit Knoxville, Kenny Pickett, pretty much had his way with the Vols\u2019 secondary. That figures to be good news for Ole Miss\u2019 Matt Corral.No. 20 Brigham Young at Baylor3:30 p.m. ET, ESPNWhy watch: BYU\u2019s hopes of landing a major bowl invitation were severely diminished by last week\u2019s home loss to Boise State. A New Year\u2019s Six spot might still be possible given the level of chaos around the sport, but the Cougars will need to bounce back quickly for this road challenge before even thinking about that.The Bears shook off their first loss of the campaign with a convincing triumph against West Virginia and now look to move back into the top 25. Both teams find ways to move the ball effectively, so this one should be entertaining. BYU QB Jaren Hall can be inaccurate at times but has numerous playmakers available like RB Tyler Allgeier and WR Gunner Romney. Bears\u2019 QB Gerry Bohanon has yet to throw a pick through six games, and Tyquan Thornton and R.J. Sneed lead a veteran WR group.Why it could disappoint: Turnovers proved BYU\u2019s undoing a week ago. Any further miscues on the road will be damaging, especially against an opponent that doesn\u2019t commit many.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: College football games to watch, Week 7:

to life without parole after being convicted for murdering his friend, has been placed on a ventilator after contracting COVID-19, his lawyer said Saturday.Durst, 78, was sentenced Thursday for murdering friend Susan Berman in 2000. The real estate scion was already in dire health straits during the sentencing hearing, according to his lead defense attorney, Dick DeGuerin.More from DeadlineRobert Durst Sentenced To Life In Prison For The Murder Of Susan Berman; 'The Jinx' Subject Denied New TrialRobert Durst Found Guilty Of Murder By L.A. Jury; 'The Jinx' Subject Faces Up To 25 Years Behind BarsEx-'SNL' Cast Member Laraine Newman Again Testifies In Robert Durst Trial, Claims She Was Told Of Alibi\u201cHe was having difficulty breathing and he was having difficulty communicating,\u201d DeGuerin said in an email to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cHe looked worse than I\u2019ve ever seen him and I was very worried about him.\u201dDurst has been held under guard in a wing of USC Medical Center during his murder trial.Durst, whose appearance in HBO\u2019s six-part documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst reignited interest in the Berman case, sat slumped in a wheelchair in the courtroom as the judgment was handed down. At one point, both of his representatives seemed to look at him with concern.The defendant, unshaven and mask slipping down his face, looked even more gaunt than usual, his breathing seeming to increase as the proceeding marched toward its conclusion.It was Durst\u2019s own off-camera admission of \u201cWhat the hell did I do?\u2026Killed \u2019em all, of course\u201d in the March 2015 series finale of the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning The Jinx that saw the long-suspected murderer apprehended again by law enforcement.Arrested by the FBI on March 14 of that year on behalf of then L.A. County D.A. Jackie Lacey\u2019s office and on what appeared to be new evidence, Durst was extradited to the West Coast in fall 2015 to face California justice.Story continuesHe was convicted of first-degree murder on Sept. 17 of this year. The jury also found true the special circumstance allegations of murder while lying in wait and murder of a witness. It likewise found true allegations that Durst personally used and discharged a firearm during the commission of the crime.Durst has never come clean about whether he murdered his wife Kathie McCormack Durst in the early 1980s, which was the subject of the 2010 film All Good Things, starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. Though he was acquitted on self-defense in 2003, Durst has previously admitted to killing his Galveston, Texas rooming house neighbor Morris Black in 2001.The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month that the Westchester County District Attorney\u2019s Office in New York would be convening a grand jury within a few weeks involving the disappearance of Kathie Durst, and that the family\u2019s attorney, Robert Abrams, received an email notifying them that her family members will not be permitted to speak at Durst\u2019s Los Angeles sentencing.Durst has long been estranged from his real estate-rich family, which is known for ownership of a series of New York City skyscrapers including an investment in the World Trade Center. He split with the family when his younger brother was placed in charge of the family business, leading to a drawn-out legal battle and ultimately reached a settlement in which the family reportedly paid him $60 million to $65 million.Tom Tapp and City News Service contributed to this report.Best of DeadlineThe Most-Watched Netflix TV Shows & Movies - UpdateHalloween 2021 Programming: Frightening Films & TV Shows On Cable And Screaming - Er, Streaming - This OctoberEmmy Predictions 2022: What Could Be Grabbing The Gold A Year From Now?Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

(AP) \u2014 Ryan Hilinski threw for 267 yards and two touchdown passes on Saturday afternoon to boost Northwestern to a 21-7 victory over Rutgers.Hilinski, making his third start since transferring from South Carolina, opened the scoring for the Wildcats (3-3, 1-2 Big Ten) by capping off a 98-yard drive in the first quarter, hitting Malik Washington for a 64-yard touchdown pass. The completion \u2014 Hilinski\u2019s longest as a Wildcat \u2014 helped his team secure its first conference win of the season.\u201cI think one of the biggest things is that we\u2019re continuing to have fun,\u201d Hilinski said. \u201cThis is a game we played when we were 5 years old. I personally play best when I\u2019m having fun and just recognizing that this is a game we\u2019ve been playing our whole lives.\u201dWashington plowed through a downfield defender on his touchdown grab and finished with 84 receiving yards on five catches. Fellow wideout Stephon Robinson Jr. had 115 yards, taking pressure off a Wildcats rushing attack that struggled to get going throughout the day. Often a key to Northwestern\u2019s offensive approach, the ground game combined for just 135 yards on 48 attempts.\u201cReally proud of the squad,\u201d Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \u201cThe way they bounced back this game and these last couple weeks. I thought they put a ton of work in to get better fundamentally. We were able to carry our preparation over into the game.\u201dNorthwestern appeared to be a favorable matchup for the Scarlet Knights (3-4, 0-4 Big Ten), who were coming off three consecutive games against opponents currently ranked in the top 10. But with five of its first six drives ending in punts, Rutgers couldn\u2019t muster enough offense to avoid opening conference play with four straight losses. Though quarterback Noah Vedral hit all four of his passes on Rutgers\u2019 only scoring drive of the game, he put together an altogether inconsistent day, going 18 of 30 for 152 yards.\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d Rutgers coach Greg Schiano said. \u201cWe certainly have to assess where we are and why we\u2019re here, and see what we can do to fix it. Some of it is personnel, some of it is execution. We\u2019re trying to find an answer.\u201dStory continuesMarshall Lang added a 2-yard touchdown reception in the second and Andrew Clair\u2019s fourth-quarter TD run padded the lead for Northwestern, which led 14-7 at halftime.The Scarlet Knights came up short on an opportunity to tighten the game in the third, as Valentino Ambrosio missed a 33-yard field goal after a delay of game penalty forced the team to scrap an attempt to go for it on fourth down.THE TAKEAWAYRutgers: After losing four straight, the Scarlet Knights\u2019 3-0 start to the season is drifting further into the rear-view. Ending this skid will require improved play from a defense which has allowed a combined 1,531 yards over its last three games. Another shaky performance from Vedral means coach Schiano likely won\u2019t be dodging questions about a QB swap anytime soon. Rutgers will get a chance to regroup with a bye this coming week, followed by a visit to Illinois.Northwestern: The Wildcats needed a win to salvage their season after being blown out by Nebraska on Oct. 2. They got one Saturday, thanks to Hilinski and improved play from a Wildcats defense that allowed just 222 total yards. While one strong showing against an average Rutgers offense won\u2019t solve all of Northwestern\u2019s defensive concerns, the performance can certainly serve as a building block. The Wildcats will need to maintain as much momentum from the victory as possible, as their next three weeks include games against two top-10 opponents in Michigan and Iowa.QB1Hilinski opened the year at third string for the Wildcats, but has seen his weekly pass yardage climb with each start. Northwestern cycled through three quarterbacks within its first three games, and will need stability at that position if it wants to recover from a shaky start to the season. With yet another productive performance, Hilinski may just be able to provide that for the Wildcats.PROPS TO THE PUNTERFresh off winning the Ray Guy Punter of the Week award for the third time this season, Rutgers punter Adam Korsak put forth another solid effort on Saturday. He logged 403 yards on nine punts, four of which landed inside the 20-yard line.FLAGS GALORERutgers entered the game tied with the second-fewest penalties in the Big Ten this season, but was flagged frequently Saturday. The Scarlet Knights were hit with 11 penalties for 91 yards, including an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for sideline interference that helped Northwestern keep a fourth-quarter scoring drive alive.UP NEXTRutgers: At Illinois on Oct. 30.Northwestern: At Michigan on Saturday.___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.Sign up for the AP\u2019s college football newsletter: https://apnews.com/cfbtop25", "preprocessed": "evanston ill ap ryan hilinski threw yard two touchdown pas saturday afternoon boost northwestern victori rutger hilinski make third start sinc transfer south carolina open score wildcat big ten cap yard drive first quarter hit malik washington yard touchdown pas complet hilinski longest wildcat help team secur first confer win season think one biggest thing continu fun hilinski said game play year old person play best fun recogn game play whole live washington plow downfield defend touchdown grab finish receiv yard five catch fellow wideout stephon robinson jr yard take pressur wildcat rush attack struggl get go throughout day often key northwestern offens approach ground game combin yard attempt realli proud squad northwestern coach pat fitzgerald said way bounc back game last coupl week thought put ton work get better fundament abl carri prepar game northwestern appear favor matchup scarlet knight big ten come three consecut game oppon current rank top five first six drive end punt rutger muster enough offens avoid open confer play four straight loss though quarterback noah vedral hit four pas rutger score drive game put togeth altogeth inconsist day go yard disappoint rutger coach greg schiano said certainli ass see fix personnel execut tri find answer stori continuesmarshal lang ad yard touchdown recept second andrew clair fourth quarter td run pad lead northwestern led halftim scarlet knight came short opportun tighten game third valentino ambrosio miss yard field goal delay game penalti forc team scrap attempt go fourth takeawayrutg lose four straight scarlet knight start season drift rear view end skid requir improv play defens allow combin yard last three game anoth shaki perform vedral mean coach schiano like dodg question qb swap anytim soon rutger get chanc regroup bye come week follow visit illinoi northwestern wildcat need win salvag season blown nebraska oct got one saturday thank hilinski improv play wildcat defens allow total yard one strong show averag rutger offens solv northwestern defens concern perform certainli serv build block wildcat need maintain much momentum victori possibl next three week includ game two top oppon michigan iowa qb hilinski open year third string wildcat seen weekli pas yardag climb start northwestern cycl three quarterback within first three game need stabil posit want recov shaki start season yet anoth product perform hilinski may abl provid wildcat prop punterfresh win ray guy punter week award third time season rutger punter adam korsak put forth anoth solid effort saturday log yard nine punt four land insid yard line flag galorerutg enter game tie second fewest penalti big ten season flag frequent saturday scarlet knight hit penalti yard includ unsportsmanlik conduct penalti sidelin interfer help northwestern keep fourth quarter score drive aliv nextrutg illinoi oct northwestern michigan saturday ap colleg footbal http apnew com hub colleg footbal http twitter com ap top sign ap colleg footbal newslett http apnew com cfbtop"}, {"title": "Twitter reacts to Eagles RB Miles Sanders getting 1 carry in the first half vs. Bucs", "author": "Glenn Erby", "date": "October 14, 2021, 10:51 PM", "body": "Miles Sanders is one of the top young running backs in the NFL, but if he\u2019s underused and not properly utilized in an offense, then his value is all for naught.Through one half of action in Philadelphia, Sanders had one total carry against the Buccaneers, as head coach and play-caller Nick Sirianni, chose to call 15 passing plays, along with Jalen Hurts having almost 10 rushing attempts as he works to carry the load against the Buccaneers stout defense.The Bucs have the NFL\u2019s best-run defense, but that still didn\u2019t stop the hot takes and Monday Morning Quarterbacking.Social media was ablaze on Thursday night, and the Twitter reactions were priceless.ESPN anchor dumbfoundedMandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY SportsMiles Sanders has one carry and one catch so far.

An even worse call ended a thrilling NLDS between the two best teams in baseball.\u00a0The 109-win season ended with a 2-1 loss to the Dodgers on Thursday night. The final strike of one of the best seasons in franchise history was not a strike. Wilmer Flores checked his swing with two outs, two strikes and the tying run on first, but first base umpire Gabe Morales rung him up.\u00a0This \"swing\" ended the Giants' season ... pic.twitter.com/MAB5mhaYAq\u2014 SF Giants on NBCS (@NBCSGiants) October 15, 2021That was it for the NL West champs, who looked on in disbelief. It was also an awful way to end an all-time classic Game 5.\u00a0The Dodgers had taken the lead on Cody Bellinger's single in the top of the ninth and turned the series over to Game 3 starter Max Scherzer, who had never before had a save opportunity in the big leagues. Justin Turner's error put Kris Bryant on first, but LaMonte Wade Jr. went down looking and Flores went down on the call.\u00a0The night ended perhaps the best one-on-one race in MLB history. The Giants won 107 games in the regular season and the Dodgers won 106 before taking the Wild Card Game. Both teams took a game at home and one on the road to begin this thrilling NLDS, and the Giants entered the night with a 12-11 edge in the season series.The rivals were meant to stay side by side through the tape, and in Game 5 they delivered behind 24-year-old Logan Webb and 25-year-old Julio Urias.Through 5 1/3 innings, just one Dodger had a hit, but he was a big problem. Mookie Betts singled his first two times up but was stranded. With one out in the sixth he picked up the third hit of the night off Webb, and he immediately took off for second. Corey Seager poked a changeup into left and Betts jogged home for the game's first run.\u00a0Story continuesWebb kept Seager at second by striking out Trea Turner and getting Will Smith to fly out to the track, and Darin Ruf immediately rewarded him. Ruf had awful luck his first two times up, but he crushed a 452-foot homer to dead center while leading off the bottom of the sixth.\u00a0Tyler Rogers took over in the eighth and put two runners on with one out, but he struck out Seager. Gabe Kapler turned to Camilo Doval, who got a huge ovation as he emerged from the bullpen and got Turner to fly out on the first pitch.Doval hit Turner with one out in the ninth and Gavin Lux followed with a single. For some reason, the rookie who hits 102 mph threw four straight sliders to Bellinger, who struggled with velocity this season. He lined the final one into right-center to give the Dodgers the lead.\u00a0The AceWebb's second half and Game 162 performance were great, but the postseason is what has really cemented him as the staff ace, and one of the game's best young pitchers. He has the look of someone who is going to start on Opening Day for the Giants for years to come.\u00a0Webb allowed just four hits and struck out seven, nearly matching his brilliance in Game 1. Through his first two postseason starts, Webb has thrown 14 2/3 innings, allowed one run and struck out 17.\u00a0Webb surprised the Dodgers in Game 1 by throwing 39 changeups, but he leaned heavily on a two-seamer with extreme horizontal break early on. After establishing that pitch, he started firing changeups and sliders at the Dodgers, who grounded back to the mound four times.Buster Posey calls all three of Webb's pitches elite, and the Giants leaned on them equally. Webb threw 36 fastballs, 35 sliders and 35 changeups.\u00a0Ruf Guy To FaceRuf hit a ball 377 feet in his first at-bat and watched as Betts chased it down a couple of feet in front of the right field wall. It would have been a homer in 12 MLB ballparks. He added a foot in his next at-bat, but again ended up with a long fly ball. He was 0-for-2 despite hitting balls with expected averages of .530 and .500The third time up, Ruf worked a 3-2 count against Urias and then attacked a fastball that was supposed to be up and in but leaked out over the plate. Gavin Lux turned and watched as the 110 mph liner landed halfway up the net that covers the bar area out in center field.\u00a0RUF TIES THE GAMEpic.twitter.com/X5IffM8vxp\u2014 SF Giants on NBCS (@NBCSGiants) October 15, 2021The homer was the longest by Ruf since Statcast began tracking in 2015, although he did spend a lot of that time playing overseas. It was his first career playoff homer.\u00a0The OpenerDave Roberts shocked the baseball world on Thursday morning when the Dodgers switched their starter from Urias to Corey Knebel, but the plan worked out pretty well, despite some hairy moments. Knebel gave up a long and loud fly ball from Ruf and a double off the wall from Buster Posey, but threw a nasty curveball to Brandon Crawford to end the first inning.\u00a0Brusdar Graterol, not Urias, took the second inning and stranded a pair of runners. The Dodgers essentially took the two hard-throwing right-handers who usually get the ball to the back end of their bullpen and moved them up ahead of Urias, and they got two scoreless innings out of them.\u00a0Urias ended up pitching the third through sixth innings, allowing the one run on three hits. He struck out five.\u00a0", "preprocessed": "learn giant season end controversi origin appear nbc sport bayareabox scoresan francisco darin ruf check swing call heart giant incred season long rivalri lo angel dodger even wors call end thrill nld two best team basebal win season end loss dodger thursday night final strike one best season franchis histori strike wilmer flore check swing two out two strike tie run first first base umpir gabe moral rung swing end giant season pic twitter com mab mhayaq sf giant nbc nbcsgiant octob nl west champ look disbelief also aw way end time classic game dodger taken lead codi belling singl top ninth turn seri game starter max scherzer never save opportun big leagu justin turner error put kri bryant first lamont wade jr went look flore went call night end perhap best one one race mlb histori giant game regular season dodger take wild card game team took game home one road begin thrill nld giant enter night edg season seri rival meant stay side side tape game deliv behind year old logan webb year old julio uria inning one dodger hit big problem mooki bett singl first two time strand one sixth pick third hit night webb immedi took second corey seager poke changeup left bett jog home game first run stori continueswebb kept seager second strike trea turner get smith fli track darin ruf immedi reward ruf aw luck first two time crush foot homer dead center lead bottom sixth tyler roger took eighth put two runner one struck seager gabe kapler turn camilo doval got huge ovat emerg bullpen got turner fli first pitch doval hit turner one ninth gavin lux follow singl reason rooki hit mph threw four straight slider belling struggl veloc season line final one right center give dodger lead acewebb second half game perform great postseason realli cement staff ace one game best young pitcher look someon go start open day giant year come webb allow four hit struck seven nearli match brillianc game first two postseason start webb thrown inning allow one run struck webb surpris dodger game throw changeup lean heavili two seamer extrem horizont break earli establish pitch start fire changeup slider dodger ground back mound four time buster posey call three webb pitch elit giant lean equal webb threw fastbal slider changeup ruf guy faceruf hit ball foot first bat watch bett chase coupl foot front right field wall would homer mlb ballpark ad foot next bat end long fli ball despit hit ball expect averag third time ruf work count uria attack fastbal suppos leak plate gavin lux turn watch mph liner land halfway net cover bar area center field ruf tie gamep twitter com x iffm vxp sf giant nbc nbcsgiant octob homer longest ruf sinc statcast began track although spend lot time play oversea first career playoff homer openerdav robert shock basebal world thursday morn dodger switch starter uria corey knebel plan work pretti well despit hairi moment knebel gave long loud fli ball ruf doubl wall buster posey threw nasti curvebal brandon crawford end first inning brusdar graterol uria took second inning strand pair runner dodger essenti took two hard throw right hander usual get ball back end bullpen move ahead uria got two scoreless inning uria end pitch third sixth inning allow one run three hit struck five"}, {"title": "'Citizen' Biden fine to push for DOJ prosecutions, Capitol riot panel Democrat says", "author": "Daniel Chaitin, Jerry Dunleavy", "date": "October 16, 2021, 5:47 PM", "body": "A prominent member of the House Jan. 6 select committee gave cover to President Joe Biden for saying the Justice Department should prosecute anyone who defies subpoenas from Capitol riot investigators.Rep. Jamie Raskin, who previously accused former President Donald Trump of improperly pressuring his Justice Department to his political whims, argued people are hazy on how a healthy relationship between the White House and the DOJ should look like after four years of the Trump administration.\"The first thing he said was that the committee should aggressively enforce our right to get people's testimony and to get the documents we've subpoenaed, and there is no problem with that,\" the Maryland Democrat told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday.\"I also don't have a problem with him, as a citizen like me, saying he hopes the Department of Justice will aggressively enforce the law, so people don't get away with committing crimes like this,\" he added.\"Obviously, four years of Donald Trump has made everybody a little bit rusty in terms of executive branch relationships with the president and law enforcement in the Department of Justice, and I don't think he was telling the Department of Justice what to do, but they will make their own decision, and we have confidence that the attorney general will do the right thing and DOJ will make the right decision,\" Raskin said.\"There will be, I predict, a criminal referral. We're going to try to charge these people with criminal contempt. That's a crime when Steve Bannon did not show up when he was told to show up... to testify before the US Congress.\"- Jan. 6 select committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin pic.twitter.com/cNG8Kg4rfV\u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 16, 2021The Justice Department quickly issued a vow of independence from the White House after Biden was asked Friday if the agency should prosecute anyone who resists subpoenas from the House Jan. 6 select committee, which has already committed to criminal contempt proceedings against one Trump ally. \"I do, yes,\" Biden said to reporters after Marine One landed on the South Lawn of the White House following a visit to Connecticut.Story continuesIn response to Biden's comment, which conflicts with a pledge he made months ago to allow the Justice Department to remain independent, the agency stressed prosecutorial decisions would be kept free of White House influence.\"The Department of Justice will make its own independent decisions in all prosecutions based solely on the facts and the law. Period. Full stop,\" DOJ spokesman Anthony Coley told the Washington Examiner.Raskin, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, later conceded the Justice Department \"reminded\" Biden about its independence.CAPITOL RIOT INVESTIGATORS 'ENGAGED' WITH US MARSHALS\"If the Department of Justice acts like a real Department of Justice, and I think they will, as you know, they just reminded the president that they're going to make their own decisions based on the facts and the law. I think they're serious about their job,\" he said.Only months ago, Raskin, who was the lead manager in the second impeachment trial against Trump, chastised Trump for working \"very hard to try to convert the Department of Justice into a personal and political law firm for his own interests up until the very end.\"In an interview with C-SPAN in June, Raskin added, \u201cWe cannot accept this kind of politicization of the Department of Justice and the conversion of DOJ lawyers into a political weapon against the president\u2019s enemies \u2014 or perceived enemies.\u201dOn Friday, Biden also endorsed the House Jan. 6 select committee's efforts to enforce its subpoenas one day after the panel announced it was moving forward with holding former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in criminal contempt for failing to show up for a deposition after Trump urged his former advisers to resist the subpoenas.\"I hope that the committee goes after them and holds them accountable criminally,\" Biden said.Raskin told Cooper he is \"not aware\" of the Capitol riot panel being in contact with the White House about discussions with former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and others about discussions surrounding the subpoenas.The Jan. 6 committee has scheduled a 7:30 p.m. vote Tuesday to recommend criminal contempt for Bannon. If passed, it will go to the full House for consideration. If the Justice Department prosecutes Bannon and he is convicted, he could face fines up to $100,000 and up to a year in prison.Investigators have looked into efforts by Trump to push his Justice Department to do his bidding, including in relation to special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry and challenging the results of the 2020 election. Trump's willingness to tweet about the Justice Department, before he was banned from Twitter, even prompted his attorney general, William Barr, to grouse about how it \"made it impossible for me to do my job.\"It was revealed that Biden selected Merrick Garland to be his attorney general on Jan. 6, the same day as the siege of the Capitol, and he introduced the longtime judge as his pick the next day.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\u201cMore than anything, we need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation that has been so badly damaged,\u201d Biden declared.Garland himself vowed, in his opening statement for a February confirmation hearing as Biden's nominee, to enforce \u201cpolicies that protect the independence of the Department from partisan influence in law enforcement Investigations.\"Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans warned Garland this month against using federal law enforcement to \u201cchill\u201d or prosecute First Amendment-protected speech opposing \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in classrooms following a DOJ memo about alleged threats and violence at school protests. DOJ officials have defended the memo as necessary to address alleged threats and intimidation.The GOP members and concerned parents have raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest for the attorney general because his son-in-law, Alexander \u201cXan\u201d Tanner, is the co-founder of Panorama Education, a software firm in thousands of schools that uses \u201csocial emotional

co-CEO Ted Sarandos for defending Dave Chappelle\u2019s new stand-up special, \u201cThe Closer,\u201d despite its jokes about the transgender community.\u201cHey Ted Sarandos! Just a quick note to let you know that I would prefer if you didn\u2019t drag my name into your mess. Now I have to deal with even more of the hate and anger that Dave Chappelle\u2019s fans like to unleash on me every time Dave gets 20 million dollars to process his emotionally stunted partial word view,\u201d Gadsby, who is trans, posted to her Instagram. \u201cYou didn\u2019t pay me nearly enough to deal with the real world consequences of the hate speech dog whistling you refuse to acknowledge, Ted. F\u2014 you and your amoral algorithm cult\u2026. I do s\u2014s with more back bone than you. That\u2019s just a joke! I definitely didn\u2019t cross a line because you just told the world there isn\u2019t one.\u201dGadsby captioned her post: \u201cYes I watched the whole thing. Leave me alone,\u201d adding the hashtags \u201c#transisbeautiful #comedyisdead #ikilledit.\u201dGadsby is not alone in her criticism of Sarandos. The LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD on Wednesday publicly rebuked the Netflix boss over a memo he sent to staffers in which he defended the company\u2019s decision to continue streaming Chappelle\u2019s special despite uproar over its transphobic commentary. In the leaked memo, Sarandos claimed that \u201ccontent on screen doesn\u2019t directly translate to real-world harm.\u201d\u201cGLAAD was founded 36 years ago because media representation has consequences for LGBTQ people. Authentic media stories about LGBTQ lives have been cited as directly responsible for increasing public support for issues like marriage equality,\u201d GLAAD said in a statement. \u201cBut\u00a0film and TV have also been filled with stereotypes and misinformation about us for decades, leading to real world harm, especially for trans people and LGBTQ people of color.\u201dIn Sarandos\u2019 memo,\u00a0first published by Variety, he amplified remarks he\u2019d already made in defense of the comedy special. He first noted that Netflix serves \u201ca diversity of tastes\u201d as it entertains \u201cthe world,\u201d and reiterated previous statements defending \u201cartistic freedom to help attract the best creators and push back on government and other censorship requests.\u201dStory continuesSarandos acknowledged that criticism about \u201cThe Closer\u201d \u201cis not about offensive-to-some content but titles which could increase real-world harm (such as further marginalizing already marginalized groups, hate, violence etc.),\u201d but said, \u201cwe have a strong belief that content on screen doesn\u2019t directly translate to real-world harm.\u201dTo back that statement, Sarandos cited the popularity of violent video games despite the historic plummeting of real-world violence. \u201cAdults can watch violence, assault and abuse \u2013 or enjoy shocking stand-up comedy \u2013 without it causing them to harm others,\u201d Sarandos said in the memo. \u201cWe are working hard to ensure marginalized communities aren\u2019t defined by a single story. So we have Sex Education, Orange is the New Black, Control Z, Hannah Gadsby and Dave Chappelle all on Netflix. Key to this is increasing diversity on the content team itself.\u201dThe backlash against \u201cThe Closer\u201d has even come from Netflix employees; an undetermined number of trans employees and allies will be staging a walkout in protest on Oct. 20.Gadsby has two stand-up comedy specials on Netflix: \u201cNanette\u201d from 2018 and 2020\u2019s \u201cDouglas.\u201dSee Gadsby\u2019s Instagram post below.

Trump called into the event and once again endorsed Youngkin, a candidate he has previously backed but also criticized for not welcoming his support enthusiastically enough.Trump\u2019s involvement in the event, however, almost seemed part of a larger plan to divert attention away from Youngkin, who polls show is within striking distance of Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe, and back to the former president.Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters at a recent rally in Des Moines, Iowa. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)In a bizarre twist, attendees at the Bannon rally also recited the Pledge of Allegiance while facing an American flag that appeared to be used as a quasi-religious object memorializing the Jan. 6 insurrection. Organizers said the flag had been carried by someone who traveled to Washington on Jan. 6, when Trump supporters launched a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol building in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election after Trump implored them to march to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s rally, an organizer claimed the flag was held at a \u201cpeaceful rally.\u201dAnd on Thursday, Bannon was again in the news, as the Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection said they would be voting next week to refer him to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution for refusing to honor a subpoena.McAuliffe quickly seized on the insertion of Trump and his allies into the race. \u201cGlenn Youngkin needs to disavow the insurrection,\u201d McAuliffe said in a hastily arranged Zoom press conference Thursday morning with reporters. \u201cI would love to hear my opponent say what they did on the Capitol grounds on January 6 is unacceptable. ... Say the January 6 insurrection was wrong.\u201dRepublican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)Later in the day, with social media still buzzing over the flag incident, Youngkin released a written statement. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt is weird and wrong to pledge allegiance to a flag connected to January 6,\u201d it read. \u201cAs I have said many times before, the violence that occurred on January 6 was sickening and wrong.\"Story continuesWhile the rally\u2019s Jan. 6 leitmotif came as an unwelcome link between the Republican candidate and the former president\u2019s attempt to overturn his election loss, Youngkin did his best to place the blame on McAuliffe, who he said \u201cwants to talk about the past because he sees this race is slipping away from him.\u201dIndeed, McAuliffe has for months tried to make Trump a central issue in the governor\u2019s race, but with limited success until Wednesday. Youngkin had done enough to satisfy Trump supporters but also kept his distance from the former president, who continues to promote election falsehoods.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Trump stuff has worked on [Youngkin] to date because he just doesn\u2019t come across that way,\u201d Tucker Martin, who worked as an aide to former Gov. Bob McDonnell, told Yahoo News. Martin said the question for Youngkin as the campaign enters the final stretch before Election Day on Nov. 2, is how long Trump remains a focus in the race.Former Virginia Gov. and current Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)Trump is a toxic figure in key areas of the state: the highly populous northern Virginia suburbs and exurbs, the Richmond metropolitan area, and parts of the Hampton Roads and Norfolk areas. He turns off moderate Republicans and independents, and perhaps more important for Democrats, Trump has proven to be an effective way to get large numbers of Democratic voters out to the polls.In the 2017 governor\u2019s race that was won by current Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who is limited by state constitution to one term in office, Northam received almost 100,000 more votes in northern Virginia than McAuliffe in 2013 (when McAuliffe won the governorship), and Republican turnout actually went down in that part of the state.Northam, who served in the Army and graduated from the Virginia Military Institute, also won in areas such as Virginia Beach, a region with a heavy military presence, and where McAuliffe lost in 2013, before Trump\u2019s arrival on the political landscape.And in 2020, Trump lost Virginia to President Biden by a 10-point margin.But Trump is no longer in office, and some moderate Republicans and independents have been turned off by the leftward turn of the Virginia Legislature, another consequence of the 2017 election. President Biden\u2019s slumping approval numbers and a stalled Democratic agenda on Capitol Hill may also depress turnout from Democrats, who have expressed a desire to tune out from politics now that Trump is out of office.President Biden speaks at a campaign event for McAuliffe in Arlington, Va., in July. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s star turn in the Virginia race on Wednesday and Thursday could prove important. Not everyone sees it that way, however. His addition to the local news cycle on Thursday is \u201cephemeral,\u201d said Chris Saxman, a former Republican delegate in the Legislature who now runs Virginia Free, a business advocacy group. \u201c[It] won\u2019t move many who have yet to vote. Economic issues are starting to dominate and independents have shifted,\u201d Saxman told Yahoo News.Inflation, the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and Biden\u2019s chaotic pullout from Afghanistan have turned the tide for voters who may have pulled the lever for Republicans before Trump but could not stomach the former president, Saxman said.Nervous Democrats are now bringing in the big guns to campaign in the state, which will further nationalize the race and potentially draw more interest from Trump. Stacey Abrams of Georgia will campaign with McAuliffe on Sunday, and former President Barack Obama will campaign with McAuliffe on Oct. 23. McAuliffe has said Biden will appear in the state on his behalf, though no date has yet been announced.If the Trump news cycle is not momentary, it will serve to motivate and activate many of the voters in northern Virginia who helped Biden win in 2020 and pushed Northam to victory in 2017. And at that point, the only thing that might prevent Trump from losing the race for Youngkin is the former private equity CEO\u2019s country club appeal, political outsider status and personal charisma.On the other hand, he may be hoping to get Trump back out of the pool as quickly as possible.\u00a0____Read more from Yahoo News:How climate-change-fueled wildfires have changed life in

right-wing tabloid The Daily Caller last month that such incidents, including one at a NASCAR race in which an NBC reporter misheard the vulgar chant as \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon,\u201d show that

Most pitchers say yes, hitters not so much. Sometimes the bat moves very little but he offered, other times it moves a lot but he in fact checked it (didn\u2019t offer).

Smith was sentenced to nine years to life in prison.Derrick\u2019s parents, Dale and Doreen Robie, opposed Smith\u2019s release each time it was previously considered and have lobbied for parole reforms that include extending the time between hearings for violent offenders from the current two years to five.Dale Robie told local media the family did not want to comment on the latest decision.Smith is housed at the medium-security Woodbourne Correctional Facility in the Catskills.", "preprocessed": "albani n ap eric smith kill year old boy rock western new york grant parol correct offici said saturday smith appear th time board parol octob grant releas earli nov depart correct commun supervis said email statement transcript hear immedi releas smith convict second degre murder lure derrick robi wood near younger boy home strike head rock derrick walk alon summer camp park steuben counti villag savona august case got wide public tender age victim suspect along wide circul photo adolesc smith court wear bug bunni sweatshirt mop red hair smith lawyer unsuccess argu mental ill smith sentenc nine year life prison derrick parent dale doreen robi oppos smith releas time previous consid lobbi parol reform includ extend time hear violent offend current two year five dale robi told local medium famili want comment latest decis smith hous medium secur woodbourn correct facil catskil"}, {"title": "Why American workers are quitting in record numbers", "author": "Mike Bebernes", "date": "October 16, 2021, 10:11 AM", "body": "\u201cThe 360\u201d shows you diverse perspectives on the day\u2019s top stories and debates.What\u2019s happeningThe number of Americans quitting their jobs has hit record highs over the past several months in a phenomenon economists have been calling the \u201cGreat Resignation.\u201d In August, 4.3 million U.S. workers \u2014 almost 3 percent of the entire American workforce \u2014 voluntarily left their positions, the highest number since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking \u201cquits\u201d in 2020.Workers are quitting at high rates in every industry, but the trend has been especially pronounced for frontline businesses like restaurants, hotels, retail stores and health care providers. Recent quit rates are a stark contrast to early in the coronavirus pandemic, when the number of quits plummeted to the lowest levels in a decade, as COVID-related business closures put millions of Americans out of work.The Great Resignation comes at a time when businesses across the country are struggling to find workers to fill open positions. There were 10.4 million job openings in August, down slightly from the record of 11.1 million openings the previous month.Economists generally believe that relatively high quit rates are a signal of a healthy economy, since it suggests workers feel optimistic about their prospects and have leverage to improve their circumstances. In the short term, however, some worry that having so many companies unable to meet staffing needs could slow economic recovery and contribute to mounting supply chain issues.Why there\u2019s debateRather than offering one reason so many Americans are quitting their jobs, experts mostly believe the Great Resignation is the result of a variety of forces coming together. Something not on that list is employer vaccine mandates, which don\u2019t appear to have caused a significant number of people to quit.One of the most common explanations is that workers are simply burned-out. The high quit rates in customer-facing jobs and health care suggest that people in these fields have become exhausted after 18 months of extra hours, confrontations over COVID mitigation rules and fear of catching the virus. Many white-collar workers, on the other hand, may be eager to maintain some of the elements of pandemic-era work that benefitted them \u2014 like remote work and flexible hours \u2014 and willing to move on as their employers transition back to the office.Story continuesOthers see the Great Resignation as the sign of a major shift in the power dynamic between workers and their employers. Labor Bureau data doesn\u2019t track whether people quitting are finding another position, but record levels of job openings mean prospects for quitters have never been higher. While many have struggled financially during the pandemic, a large share of Americans have actually increased their savings \u2014 meaning they have more of a cushion to absorb a job transition. These factors mean workers have greater freedom to leave unsatisfying jobs to pursue something that suits them better.On top of these short-term influences, some experts argue that the pandemic has had a more fundamental and lasting impact on Americans\u2019 relationship with work. They argue that the human tragedy \u2014 and, in some cases, indifference from their employers \u2014 that workers have experienced over the past year and a half has led millions of people to deprioritize work in their lives.What\u2019s nextThe big unanswered question about the Great Resignation is whether it\u2019s a short-term phenomenon brought on by extreme circumstances or a more lasting shift in attitudes toward work. If it is in fact temporary, it\u2019s possible there could be a correction in the near future that sees quits drop dramatically, some economists say.PerspectivesFrontline workers are fed up\u201cFrontline workers in health care, child care, hospitality and food service industries, pushed to the brink of human endurance, decide that the grueling hours, inadequate pay, lack of balance and abuse by employers and clientele are no longer acceptable trade-offs for their mental and physical well-being.\u201d \u2014 Karla L. Miller, Washington PostTough jobs became intolerable with the added stressors of the pandemic\u201cCovid-19 placed systemic problems in sharp relief. Workers were expected to show up every day and risk their health for far less than a living wage, without the support of child care or benefits. What was a raw deal before became, for many, untenable.\u201d \u2014 Laura Entis, VoxLots of job openings mean it\u2019s easy for workers to move on to something better\u201cPeople have options. And because they have options, their demands and their interests and their tolerance for things that are not aligned with their values on how they want to live their lives, they're going to leave and they're going to look for it elsewhere.\u201d \u2014 Tsedal Neeley, Harvard Business School professor, to PBS NewsHourThe balance of power has shifted in workers\u2019 favor\u201cFor at least two generations, workers have been on their back heels. We are now seeing a labor market that is tight, and prospects are becoming increasingly clear that it\u2019s going to remain tight. It\u2019s now going to be a workers\u2019 market, and they\u2019re empowered. I think they are starting to flex their collective muscle.\u201d \u2014 Mark Zandi, economist, to TimeThe pandemic accelerated a generational shift in attitudes toward work\u201cThe Great Resignation is not a mad dash away from the office; it\u2019s the culmination of a long march toward freedom. More than a decade ago, psychologists documented a generational shift in the centrality of work in our lives. Millennials were more interested in jobs that provided leisure time and vacation time than Gen Xers and baby boomers. They were less concerned about net worth than net freedom.\u201d \u2014 Adam Grant, Wall Street JournalMany employers took their workers for granted during the COVID recession\u201cSee, since forever, the conventional wisdom held that in downturns, the employer could get away with almost anything; employees needed work and so would be grateful merely to have a job \u2014 frills and niceties were 100 percent unnecessary. But the common thread that runs through virtually every motivation for the Great Resignation departures we are seeing is a decision to no longer accept the unacceptable.\u201d \u2014 Phillip Kane, Inc.The pandemic led millions to reevaluate their priorities\u201cWe know that when human beings come into contact with death and illness in their lives, it causes them to take a step back and ask existential questions. Like, what gives me purpose and happiness in life, and does that match up with how I'm spending my [life] right now? So, in many cases, those reflections will lead to life pivots.\u201d \u2014 Anthony Klotz, psychologist, to Business InsiderPandemic relief programs have given many workers more financial freedom\u201cThanks to several pandemic-relief checks, a rent moratorium, and student-loan forgiveness, everybody, particularly if they are young and have a low income, has more freedom to quit jobs they hate and hop to something else.\u201d \u2014 Derek Thompson, AtlanticSome of the current wave of quits is simply making up for last year\u2019s low quit rate\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that many of these mid-level employees may have delayed transitioning out of their roles due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, meaning that the boost we\u2019ve seen over the last several months could be the result of more than a year\u2019s worth of pent-up resignations.\u201d \u2014 Ian Cook, Harvard Business ReviewIs there a topic you\u2019d like to see covered in \u201cThe 360\u201d?

The eyes itself are the size of dinner plates.The purpleback flying squid is typically much smaller, reaching up to 650 mm, or 2 feet, according to the Encyclopedia of Life, which is hosted by the National Museum of Natural History.Story continuesThe squid is part of the sthenoteuthis oualaniensis species and is known to live in the Red Sea, Vecchione said.Rodrigue wondered if the squids inhabited shipwrecks like the one they found, but \u201dthere\u2019s no actual record of members of that family aggregating on a structure like that,\u201d Vecchione said.\u201cIt was kind of like an intentional made-for-TV moment it felt like almost because you get this massive creature with the shipwreck in the background,\u201d Rodrigue said.The OceanX crew went down to the shipwreck site three times and spotted what Rodrigue thought could be the same squid.\u201cYou know, anytime that you see weird deep-sea squids or octopodes, you know where I am,\u201d Vecchione said.See how your state has changed over 750 million years with interactive map of EarthWatch shape-shifting whalefish swim off the coast of California in rare sighting\u2018Shape-shifting\u2019 animals are growing larger body parts to survive, study finds.

Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former President Barack Obama have been tapped to appear on the campaign trail in the final weeks as McAuliffe looks to boost turnout in an off-year election.The bellwether race may have wider implications for the Democratic Party, reinforcing its brand despite Biden's sagging polls and giving a critical boost to stalled efforts in Congress to pass the president's pair of domestic spending bills. The outcome could determine whether McAuliffe's campaign is a blueprint for vulnerable Democrats in other closely divided states or a warning sign about the mood of the electorate.\"The reality is if Youngkin wins, this will be a big problem for Biden's agenda because some of the Democratic members of Congress who are on the fence on some of Biden's initiatives will be less inclined to support a president who doesn't seem to be as favorably viewed as he was a year ago,\" said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia.A 2022 warning shotDemocrats have won Virginia in every presidential election since 2008, and Biden defeated President Donald Trump there by 10 percentage points nearly a year ago.Biden's waning popularity after the fallout from the U.S. withdrawal in Afghanistan, a surging coronavirus delta variant, concerns over inflation and intraparty fighting that stalled the passage of the president's domestic agenda has been a challenge for McAuliffe.Story continues\"The 2021 campaign so far is showing us that the reports of Virginia as a blue state have been premature,\" Farnsworth said. \"This election, at least, looks like what you'd see in a purple state.\"Republican Glenn Youngkin, right, makes a point to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the final debate between the candidates before the Nov. 2 gubernatorial election.McAuliffe, a close Biden ally, cited the president's unpopularity in Virginia during a virtual meeting with supporters last week and expressed frustration over Democratic disputes that led Congress to delay voting on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a more sweeping spending package aimed at expanding the social safety net.\"They all got to get their act together and vote,\" he told The Associated Press.The Virginia Democrat's push for Congress to pass the bills underscores the belief that his political fortunes are tied to whether Democrats in Washington can effectively govern and deliver big legislative wins, according to Jessica Taylor, an analyst at The Cook Political Report.\"Democrats need some sort of win to point to after nine months in office,\" Taylor said.Biden, who stumped for McAuliffe in late July, was missing from the list of Democratic stars headed to Virginia in the final weeks before the election. McAuliffe insisted that Biden would cross the Potomac River once more before election day, Nov. 2.\"He\u2019ll be coming back. You bet he will,\" he said at an education roundtable in Alexandria Tuesday.Kyle Kondik, election analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said the state's gubernatorial race has a long history of breaking against whichever party controls the White House.\"There's a bit of a handicap for being the White House party candidate in this race,\" he said.Pundits shouldn't put too much focus on the Virginia race as a harbinger for next year, Kondik said. He pointed out that McAuliffe won in 2013 despite Obama's low approval ratings in Virginia \u2013 the first White House party candidate to break the streak of the opposite party in power winning the governor's mansion in nearly 40 years. And that didn't translate into a good turnout for the 2014 midterms when Democrats lost control of the Senate. A McAuliffe loss could have spillover consequences for candidate recruitment before next year, Kondik said, and members of Congress who may be considering retirement could take the loss as a signal that they could be serving in the minority in 2023.The Trump foil McAuliffe has taken a page from the Democratic playbook that helped California Gov. Gavin Newsom overcome a recall election last month by repeatedly assailing Youngkin as a local version of Trump and warning of a GOP-led Virginia.Youngkin has tried to strike a balance between embracing Trump's support and distancing himself from the former president to appeal to more moderate and base voters.\"This is very much a base election. Both campaigns are trying to make sure that the people who vote for them will actually show up and cast a ballot,\" Farnsworth said.If Youngkin wins or the race is closer than Democrats would like, \"that would suggest that Donald Trump was a much more useful foil for Democrats when he was president rather than when he's a former president,\" Farnsworth said.Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin speaks with members of Eastville Police Department.Youngkin, a former private equity executive, skipped a rally hosted by former Trump aide Steve Bannon on Thursday. Trump called into the event and praised Youngkin as a \"great gentleman.\"Youngkin has focused on hot button national issues such as critical race theory, which is not taught in K-8 classes in Virginia, as well as COVID-19 vaccine mandates, public safety and transgender rights in schools \u2013 a reflection of the Trump agenda, according to Taylor.\"Republicans are using this as one of the first tests to see if these issues resonate with some of those suburban voters who we saw swing heavily away from Trump last year,\" she said.Enthusiasm gapVirginia governors are prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term, which provides a national barometer of how voters feel about the party in power, Farnsworth said. The star-studded list of Democrats campaigning for McAuliffe signals concern that the election is less about reaching moderate voters and more about motivating people to turn out, raising questions about broader enthusiasm heading into next year, he said.\"A successful Democratic campaign in Virginia needs a high level of voter turnout from African Americans and voters under 30 and the list of upcoming candidate visits seems like a pretty good way to maximize the motivation of those groups,\" Farnsworth said.Virginia gubernatorial candidates, Democrat Terry McAuliffe left, and Republican Glenn Youngkin, talk during the Virginia FREE Leadership Luncheon in McLean, Va., Wednesday, Sept. 1, 2021.Lance Bottoms, who Biden considered as a running mate, and Abrams, who narrowly lost the Georgia governor's race in 2018, will appear with McAuliffe this weekend to help energize Black voters.Taylor said the use of the party's biggest surrogates underscores Democratic worry about getting voters to the ballot box. \"I think you're going to hear them really sort of emphasizing what mistakes could be made if a Republican is elected, what that could mean for the country, what that could mean for Virginia,\" she said. But the off-year electorate is whiter, more conservative and includes fewer people under 30, Farnsworth said, demographics that could benefit Youngkin.\"All those differences between the gubernatorial electorate and the presidential electorate favor the Republicans,\" he said. \"The question is do they favor the Republicans enough.\"This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Election 2021:

Polls conducted in mid-September from Stockton University and Monmouth University showed Murphy with a nine-point and 13-point lead, respectively, over Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman.While Virginians rejected former President Donald Trump at the ballot box twice and Democrats made significant gains in the commonwealth, including securing a trifecta government when he was in office, McAuliffe only has a slim 2.5-point lead over GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average.MORE: McAuliffe, Youngkin spar over vision for commonwealth in 1st Va. gubernatorial debateDespite the race tightening over the last few weeks, McAuliffe is confident Virginians will back his record and he'll once again break the so-called \"Virginia curse\" of candidates losing Virginia's off-year gubernatorial race if they have the same party affiliation as the current occupant of the White House.\"We're gonna win this again and make history again with this,\" McAuliffe told reporters Thursday. \"I am the first candidate for office of either party in 80 years to win every single city and county (in the primary). \u2026 Why? I think a.) people were happy with my job as governor before and b.) because I have a real agenda.\"Story continuesPHOTO: First lady Jill Biden speaks during a visit at the Arturo Velasquez Institute on Oct. 13 2021, in Chicago. (Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images)The first lady is not the only high-profile surrogate hitting the road for the two candidates -- former President Barack Obama will also stump for both men next week.Obama will hold back-to-back events in the states on Oct. 23, 10 days before Election Day and coinciding with the first day of in-person early voting in New Jersey's history.Georgia heavy-hitters Stacey Abrams and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who were both on the president's shortlist for vice president, are also headed to Virginia on Sunday to campaign for McAuliffe.MORE: McAuliffe calls on Youngkin to condemn pledge to flag 'carried' at Jan. 6 rallyAfter McAuliffe said during the last debate that he doesn't \"think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,\" the Youngkin campaign rallied around education as his closing message. Having the first lady, an educator who began her career in 1976, join McAuliffe on the trail could serve as an opportunity to speak to the issue and reassure parents who may be wary of his stance.Biden, who currently works as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, has made education one of the top priorities in her role as first lady.The first lady is not the first Biden to campaign for McAuliffe in the state -- President Joe Biden also made a campaign stop on behalf of his longtime friend in July -- though recent polling has shown Biden's approval ratings in the state fall, leading McAuliffe to distance himself from the president.\"We are facing a lot of headwinds from Washington, as you know. The president is unpopular today unfortunately here in Virginia, so we have got to plow through,\" McAuliffe said during a virtual rally last week. He's also said he's frustrated that Congress still hasn't passed the infrastructure package, saying the \"inaction on Capitol Hill \u2026 is so damaging.\"MORE: Obama to campaign with McAuliffe in Virginia governor's raceDespite the comments, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that she expected the president would continue to advocate for McAuliffe's candidacy.\"I think the president of course wants former Governor McAuliffe to be the future governor of Virginia. There is alignment on a lot of their agenda, whether it is the need to invest in rebuilding our roads, rails and bridges or making it easier for women to rejoin the workforce,\" Psaki told reporters.\"We're going to do everything we can to help former Governor McAuliffe and we believe in the agenda he's representing,\" she addedAnd McAuliffe has since made clear that Biden is still welcome in Virginia, telling reporters Tuesday, \"He'll be coming back.

(AP) \u2014 First lady Jill Biden campaigned Friday for Democrats in governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, saying \"this election will set a course for a year from now\u201d during her first political trip of her husband's presidency.Biden spoke at an early voting rally at Middlesex College in Edison, New Jersey, where Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is running against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, an ex-state Assembly member. She also hit an evening event in suburban Richmond, Virginia, alongside Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor who is running to regain the post and facing a tighter race than expected against Republican Glenn Youngkin, a businessman.\u201cWe can\u2019t get complacent. We have to get to work,\u201d the first lady, who was born in New Jersey and clapped on stage to \u201cIt\u2019s My Life,\u201d by New Jersey icon and President Biden supporter Jon Bon Jovi, told the crowd in Edison. The loudest applause of the event came when Jill Biden joked, \u201cHeck, today\u2019s Friday. So go grab a beer and go vote.\u201dDemocrats, eager to boost turnout for the off-year elections, dispatched the first lady to rally support in the Nov. 2 governors' races. It marks the first time that Biden has been back on the campaign trial since stumping for her husband in last year\u2019s presidential campaign, and it underscores the political stakes for the White House.In Virginia especially, which President Joe Biden won by a comfortable 10 percentage points last year, a defeat in the governor's race could spell trouble for Democrats in the 2022 midterms, when control of Congress is at risk of flipping to Republicans. The president\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to some of the lowest levels of his White House tenure amid congressional fights over infrastructure and voting rights.The first lady capped her trip by addressing a crowd of about 300 at a grassroots mobilizing rally outside a recreation center in Henrico, Virginia. She was twice interrupted by protesters who appeared to be decrying federal fossil fuel subsidies, and she said, laughing, \"You\u2019ve gotta love democracy.\u201dStory continues\u201cVirginia, you need somebody that you can trust, and that's Terry McAuliffe,\u201d Biden said. She warned of misinformation becoming more prevalent online with Election Day looming, adding, \u201cThere are a lot of people who like to twist the words around. But we know Terry. We know his heart.\"McAuliffe called Biden \u201cmy very good friend\u201d and said, \u201cI cannot tell you how much is at stake in this election.\u201d He called Youngkin a \u201cwant-a-be\u201d of former President Donald Trump.Acknowledging the stakes, President Biden noted Friday to reporters while traveling in Connecticut: \u201cNow, look, I think everybody understandably reads the two gubernatorial off-year elections as being a bellwether of what may happen. Sometimes it\u2019s been right; sometimes it\u2019s been wrong.\u201dHe continued: \u201cI think Terry is going to win. If he doesn\u2019t win, I don\u2019t know how much you read into that, but, you know, I -- well, I think he\u2019ll win.\u201dMcAuliffe said Biden would be visiting Virginia in the coming days, as are former President Barack Obama and Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate who has risen to national prominence.In Jill Biden's role as first lady, she has regularly traveled the country \u2014 including to reliably red states \u2014 to promote such issues as improving public education and community college, reopening schools amid the pandemic and urging people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.She has also continued to teach writing and English at Northern Virginia Community College, where she\u2019s held a position since 2009 \u2014 the first first lady to leave the White House to log hours at a full-time job.The first lady's travels came as the president spent Friday in Connecticut promoting a massive spending plan that Democrats are trying to muscle through Congress despite deep divisions within their own ranks over the final price tag.Also on Friday, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said it had filed an ethics complaint against White House press secretary Jen Psaki for a comment she made about McAuliffe from the briefing room.In response to a reporter\u2019s question Thursday about Virginia\u2019s election, Psaki said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to help former Gov. McAuliffe, and we believe in the agenda he\u2019s representing.\u201dAfter CREW filed its complaint, Psaki said in a CNN interview that she should have used the word \u201che\u201d instead of \u201cwe\u201d in response to the question. In a statement, Psaki said she would \u201cchoose my words more carefully moving forward.\u201d", "preprocessed": "henrico va ap first ladi jill biden campaign friday democrat governor race virginia new jersey say elect set cours year first polit trip husband presid biden spoke earli vote ralli middlesex colleg edison new jersey democrat gov phil murphi run republican jack ciattarelli ex state assembl member also hit even event suburban richmond virginia alongsid democrat terri mcauliff former governor run regain post face tighter race expect republican glenn youngkin businessman get complac get work first ladi born new jersey clap stage life new jersey icon presid biden support jon bon jovi told crowd edison loudest applaus event came jill biden joke heck today friday go grab beer go vote democrat eager boost turnout year elect dispatch first ladi ralli support nov governor race mark first time biden back campaign trial sinc stump husband last year presidenti campaign underscor polit stake white hous virginia especi presid joe biden comfort percentag point last year defeat governor race could spell troubl democrat midterm control congress risk flip republican presid approv rate fallen lowest level white hous tenur amid congression fight infrastructur vote right first ladi cap trip address crowd grassroot mobil ralli outsid recreat center henrico virginia twice interrupt protest appear decri feder fossil fuel subsidi said laugh got ta love democraci stori continu virginia need somebodi trust terri mcauliff biden said warn misinform becom preval onlin elect day loom ad lot peopl like twist word around know terri know heart mcauliff call biden good friend said tell much stake elect call youngkin want former presid donald trump acknowledg stake presid biden note friday report travel connecticut look think everybodi understand read two gubernatori year elect bellweth may happen sometim right sometim wrong continu think terri go win win know much read know well think win mcauliff said biden would visit virginia come day former presid barack obama stacey abram georgia gubernatori candid risen nation promin jill biden role first ladi regularli travel countri includ reliabl red state promot issu improv public educ commun colleg reopen school amid pandem urg peopl get vaccin coronaviru also continu teach write english northern virginia commun colleg held posit sinc first first ladi leav white hous log hour full time job first ladi travel came presid spent friday connecticut promot massiv spend plan democrat tri muscl congress despit deep divis within rank final price tag also friday govern watchdog group citizen respons ethic washington said file ethic complaint white hous press secretari jen psaki comment made mcauliff brief room respons report question thursday virginia elect psaki said go everyth help former gov mcauliff believ agenda repres crew file complaint psaki said cnn interview use word instead respons question statement psaki said would choos word care move forward"}, {"title": "Jill Biden campaigns for Terry McAuliffe in Virginia amid tight race", "author": "Sarah Ewall-Wice", "date": "October 15, 2021, 9:05 PM", "body": "Henrico, VA \u2014 First lady Jill Biden hit the campaign trail on Friday for Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe, whose race for governor against Republican Glenn Youngkin appears tight with less than three weeks until Election Day.\"Virginia needs someone who will work toward progress, not refight the battles of our past. Virginia, you need somebody that you can trust,\" the first lady said, praising McAuliffe's track record when he served as governor from 2013 to 2017.\"This race is about the next chapter of Virginia and our country,\" said McAuliffe, who spoke about the economy, public education, COVID vaccines, voting and abortion rights on Friday night.The latest CBS News polling released this week shows McAuliffe leading Youngkin by just three points among likely voters, 50% to 47%, within the margin of error. McAuliffe leads Youngkin among likely voters on who would do better with COVID vaccines. But Youngkin, a former business executive, led McAuliffe in CBS News polling among voters who said the state's economy is a major factor in their vote, and when asked which candidate's policies would create more jobs in the states.The race could set off concerns for Democrats ahead of the midterms should a Republican win statewide for the first time in more than a decade. It comes as Democrats' plans in Washington have stalled in recent weeks.It's unclear when President Biden could head back to campaign in Virginia. He campaigned for McAuliffe in July, but his approval rating has taken a hit in recent months amid a series of crises and a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant.\"We're going to do everything we can to help former Governor McAuliffe, and we believe in the agenda he's representing,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday.U.S. first lady Jill Biden campaigns for former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe during a campaign rally on October 15, 2021 in Richmond, Virginia. / Credit: Getty ImagesMcAuliffe has been critical of the recent congressional gridlock that has slowed the passage of the infrastructure bill.Story continues\"I want people on Capitol Hill to get things done,\" McAuliffe told reporters on Thursday. \"I am frustrated that we do have a bill for infrastructure which literally will bring billions of dollars \u2013 I'll get $7 billion here in Virginia just for highway construction \u2013 billions more for bridges and so forth, and I'm frustrated that a bill passed the Senate two months ago with 69 votes, and we can't get a vote out of the House.\"Some of the Virginia voters who gathered Friday to hear McAuliffe speak shared his frustration.\"I am disgusted with the West Virginia senator [Joe Manchin], I'm also disgusted with [Senator Kyrsten] Sinema. I wish the Democrats could stick together,\" said Rosalyn Gibson, who is supporting McAuliffe. \"I wish they didn't have to solely depend on the Democrats to pull it through. I wish there were more Republicans who had courage to stand up to Mitch McConnell and vote with their hearts.\"\"It takes more than just Democrats,\" said Warlisha Whisonant, who is still undecided. She said her main interest in attending the event Friday was to hear McAuliffe's platform when it comes to jobs.Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, Democratic gubernatorial candidate for Virginia for a second term, greets supporters as he arrives to cast his ballot during early voting at the Fairfax County Government Center October 13, 2021 in Fairfax, Virginia. / Credit: Getty ImagesAs McAuliffe campaigns on economic and education policies aligned with the Biden agenda such as paid leave, spending on public schools and teachers and raising the minimum wage, his campaign is looking to also tie his opponent as closely as possible to former President Donald Trump.Recent polling by Fox News showed Mr. Trump has a worse approval rating in Virginia than McAuliffe, Biden, Youngkin and current Democratic governor Ralph Northam. The former president had a favorable view among 44% of likely Virginia voters, while 53% had an unfavorable view of him.Several voters in attendance for McAuliffe's event on Friday told CBS News their main concern was not allowing Republicans in the state back into power, slamming Mr. Trump and sharing their fear over the January 6 attack.Earlier this week, Mr. Trump called into a rally in Henrico County to back Youngkin, but he has not campaigned in person for the Republican candidate in the state. At that same event, attendees also pledged allegiance to a flag that was allegedly at the Capitol on January 6.Youngkin was not at the event but has since attempted to distance himself, calling the pledge \"weird and wrong\" in a statement.When asked whether Mr. Trump would be campaigning in the state, Youngkin said on Thursday \"the person who is going to be campaigning here for the next two-and-a-half weeks is Glenn Youngkin.\"With early voting already underway, the first lady is the first of several prominent Democrats set to campaign for McAuliffe in the state ahead of Election Day.

Cory Booker acknowledged that without Black voters Democrats \u201cwill get decimated\u201d in upcoming reelections, adding \u201cWe can\u2019t let people get discouraged.\u201dU.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey assured members of the NAACP on Saturday that all hope isn\u2019t lost on the Black agenda in Washington, and made the case as to why Black voters should not sit out next year\u2019s midterm elections despite some growing weary of President Joe Biden, and Democrats at large, amid stalled bills critical for Black America.(Credit: Getty Images)Booker, who was a lead negotiator on the now failed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act along with fellow Democrat U.S. Rep. Karen Bass and Republican Senator Tim Scott, acknowledged the legislative roadblocks to police reform and voting rights in a very divided Congress.TheGrio was present at the virtual NAACP Board of Directors meeting where Booker spoke with members about critical policy issues affecting Black Americans from voting restriction laws being passed by Republicans across the country and the lack of movement to enact police reform amid continued deaths of Black Americans by the hands of police and racial violence.Booker described the negotiation collapse on the Floyd bill as evidence of a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d in the U.S. Senate.The lawmaker said that he \u201cwill not stop\u201d in his push for a pathway forward for a national standard on policing. Booker told the oldest civil rights group in the nation that he worked nine months on the bill and that he and Sen. Scott could not come to terms even as the Fraternal Order of Police supported the legislation.Scott had previously said during an interview last month that he walked away from the negotiating table because, from his view, language in the bill that would withhold federal dollars from police departments that do not comply with proposed reforms was essentially \u201cdefunding the police.\u201d Booker dismissed Scott\u2019s refusal to support the bill, touting the transparency and accountability it would\u2019ve created for America\u2019s law enforcement agencies.Story continuesRep.

James Clyburn (D-SC) following a meeting about police reform legislation on Capitol Hill May 18, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\u201cIf we can\u2019t get a bill like that it\u2019s not worth happening,\u201d Booker exclaimed.Now that the Floyd bill is essentially dead in the water, Booker vowed to work with President Biden to move forward on executive orders to address policing in America and do what he can on the legislative side to ensure the president\u2019s other policy agendas are passed in Congress. As theGrio exclusively reported on Friday, the White House is now mulling over what executive actions Biden can take to enact police reform without the help of Congress.Booker\u2019s remarks also comes after several months of voting rights protests and demonstrations in Washington, including one right outside White House gates, that led to numerous arrests including Ben Jealous, head of People For American Way. Members of Congress and the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. were also arrested in previous demonstrations. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, there have been at least 22 laws enacted by Republican state legislators that restrict voting in ways that would critically impact voters of color.Civil rights leaders have been sounding the alarm about these bills deemed as deliberate acts of voter suppression in attempts to stave off Black and Brown voters who were a key demographic in electing Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and turning Georgia blue with Biden picking up the Peach State\u2019s electoral votes and U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff winning their special run-off elections that gave Democrats a tight majority (when including Vice President Harris\u2019s tie-breaking vote) in the Senate.The Democrats\u2019 slim majority in both the House and Senate is in jeopardy if enough Republicans pick up seats in the 2022 midterm elections.TheGrio\u2018s White House Correspondent April Ryan caused waves last week during a press briefing when she asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki about the Black community\u2019s growing frustration with the Biden administration\u2019s lack of movement on key Black issues like voting rights and police reform. Ryan highlighted that Harris\u2019s own friend and Democratic strategist, Bakari Sellers, called Biden\u2019s portfolio for Harris \u201ctrash.\u201dBooker defended President Biden (and by proxy Democrats in Congress) against criticisms that he hasn\u2019t yet done enough for Black Americans.The four-term senator said that while he believes progress can still be made on the Hill as it relates to policing and voting rights, Black Americans can\u2019t allow the focus on those two policy issues \u201cdistract\u201d them from the gains for the community that have been achieved so far, including the child tax credits that Biden signed into law with the American Rescue Plan and an executive order on environmental justice equity in climate, energy and infrastructure that would ensure 40% of its spending goes to communities of color.\u201cThis president has done more on environmental justice than any president in my lifetime,\u201d said Booker, who also touted Biden for cutting the nation\u2019s child poverty in half. Sen. Booker also argued that police violence isn\u2019t the only type of violence plaguing Black communities. Gun violence and poverty, which Booker described as a form of violence, also pose as threats to Black Americans, he said.Booker also reminded NAACP leaders that the Biden administration released in June its comprehensive strategy to address and prevent gun-related crimes in communities of color.Much of the roadblock to achieving further key legislative wins for Black America falls on two moderate Democrats in the Senate, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who have refused to support a range of bills and have expressed their objection to eliminating the Senate\u2019s filibuster that would allow Democrats to overcome Republican opposition.Booker argued that the key to circumventing the power of Manchin and Sinema is Black voters showing up to the polls next November to help Democrats keep Senate seats in Georgia (Sen. Warnock) and Arizona (Sen. Mark Kelly) and pick up additional seats in states like Pennsylvania and Milwaukee, which would give Democrats a 52 majority.\u201cWithout Black voters,\u201d Booker acknowledged, \u201cwe will get decimated\u201d in the upcoming reelections. \u201cWe worked so hard in last year\u2019s election \u2026 we can\u2019t let people get discouraged.\u201dTheGrio\u2019s April Ryan contributed to this report.Have you subscribed to the Grio podcasts, \u2018Dear Culture\u2019 or Acting Up?

accused White House press secretary Jen Psaki Friday of violating the Hatch Act after her comments on the Virginia gubernatorial race.When asked about the governor's race during a Thursday press briefing, Psaki said Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe has the backing of President Joe Biden.\"I think the President, of course, wants former Governor McAuliffe to be the future governor of Virginia,\" Psaki said only weeks before the Nov. 2 election. \"We\u2019re going to do everything we can to help former Governor McAuliffe, and we believe in the agenda he\u2019s representing.\"More:

addressed a letter to the White House Office of Special Counsel requesting an investigation into whether Psaki violated the Hatch Act \u2014 a federal law prohibiting executive branch employees from \"activity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political candidate, or partisan political group.\u201d\"By mixing official government business with support of a candidate for partisan political office in the weeks before the election and engaging in political activity while on duty, Ms. Psaki appears to have used her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election, political activity that is prohibited by law,\" the letter states.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Psaki told CNN's Jake Tapper Friday that she and Biden take ethics \"seriously.\"\"As I understand it, if I said 'he' instead of 'we,' that would not have been an issue at all. And I'll be more careful with my words next time, words certainly matter,\" she said.Story continuesCREW sent a similar letter to the White House Counsel earlier this year after Psaki tweeted Biden \"clearly opposes any effort to recall Gavin Newsom.\" Newsom won the historic recall election in September.Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also criticized Psaki Thursday, tweeting that the media should hold Psaki accountable.\"There is no problem in engaging in First Amendment political activity, but it must be done separate and apart from the podium,\" she said.McEnany's tweet received a litany of responses noting her own past experiences. The former press secretary has also met with past allegations of Hatch Act violations for doubling as Trump's campaign adviser during his 2020 run for reelection.Trump's 2020 Republican presidential nominee acceptance speech at the White House raised additional concerns about Hatch Act violations.\"The shamelessness, ah the shamelessness...\" MSNBC's Mehdi Hasan, host of the \"Mehdi Hasan Show,\" wrote above a repost of McEnany's tweet.Contributing: The Associated PressReach out to Chelsey Cox on Twitter at @therealco.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jen Psaki accused of violating Hatch Act by government watchdog group", "preprocessed": "washington govern watchdog group citizen respons ethic washington accus white hous press secretari jen psaki friday violat hatch act comment virginia gubernatori race ask governor race thursday press brief psaki said democrat candid terri mcauliff back presid joe biden think presid cours want former governor mcauliff futur governor virginia psaki said week nov elect go everyth help former governor mcauliff believ agenda repres terri mcauliff v glenn youngkin virginia governor race test biden democrat casual dishonesti donald trump ex spokeswoman stephani grisham rip bookcrew address letter white hous offic special counsel request investig whether psaki violat hatch act feder law prohibit execut branch employe activ direct toward success failur polit parti partisan polit candid partisan polit group mix offici govern busi support candid partisan polit offic week elect engag polit activ duti m psaki appear use offici author influenc purpos interf affect result elect polit activ prohibit law letter state white hous immedi respond request comment psaki told cnn jake tapper friday biden take ethic serious understand said instead would issu care word next time word certainli matter said stori continuescrew sent similar letter white hous counsel earlier year psaki tweet biden clearli oppos effort recal gavin newsom newsom histor recal elect septemb former white hous press secretari kayleigh mcenani also critic psaki thursday tweet medium hold psaki account problem engag first amend polit activ must done separ apart podium said mcenani tweet receiv litani respons note past experi former press secretari also met past alleg hatch act violat doubl trump campaign advis run reelect trump republican presidenti nomine accept speech white hous rais addit concern hatch act violat shameless ah shameless msnbc mehdi hasan host mehdi hasan show wrote repost mcenani tweet contribut associ pressreach chelsey cox twitter therealco articl origin appear usa today jen psaki accus violat hatch act govern watchdog group"}, {"title": "Jill Biden stumps for Terry McAuliffe in county where GOP win could mean \u2018game over\u2019 for Democrats", "author": "Katherine Doyle", "date": "October 15, 2021, 2:34 PM", "body": "First lady Jill Biden is taking the White House's campaign pitch to the Virginia suburbs to stump for Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a competitive gubernatorial race that strategists said could foretell the party\u2019s fortunes in a slew of races next year.On Friday, Biden will travel to Henrico County, Virginia, the first of several visits to the Richmond area by top Democrats over the coming weeks.For years, Henrico was a Republican stronghold. Now, it\u2019s a blue district that is seen as mimicking Virginia statewide. The Richmond suburb is home to Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a centrist Democrat who has railed against the party\u2019s focus on far-left policies. She won reelection narrowly last year.Republican political strategist Shaun Kenney said the GOP has gained traction in the suburbs around major cities, such as Henrico.WHITE HOUSE INSISTS INFLATION IS DECREASING AFTER RECORD SETTING NUMBERS\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing a lot of enthusiasm for Youngkin right now \u2014 in the suburbs that were kind of a blue wing and then went very hard blue in 2017,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cThey\u2019re now coming back home.\u201dA former executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, Kenney said the way Henrico votes in the Nov. 2 gubernatorial race could be a bellwether both for the state and for congressional races in 2022.\u201cIf Henrico County falls into the Republican column convincingly, game over,\u201d Kenney said. He said the same was true for Chesterfield County, south of Richmond.Virginia has seen this pattern before.In 2008, the state voted for Barack Obama for president before electing Republican Bob McDonnell as governor by a comfortable margin the following year. McDonnell garnered 59% of the vote to Democrat Creigh Deeds\u2019s 41%, the highest vote percentage of any candidate for governor since 1961 at the time.McAuliffe has lost ground in recent weeks to Youngkin, his lead collapsing by more than half since August. Youngkin, a businessman and political neophyte, has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.Story continuesThe margins are slim. A new poll from the Trafalgar Group conducted between Monday and Wednesday shows Youngkin leading McAuliffe for the first time, 48.4% to 47.5%.The former governor also faces an enthusiasm gap, according to a Wason Center poll conducted between Sept. 27 and Oct. 1. The survey shows 61% Republican likely voters said they are \"very enthusiastic\" about casting a ballot in the Nov. 2 race, compared to 55% of likely Democratic voters.Democrats are attempting to narrow this advantage, bringing a slew of big names to the state to campaign for McAuliffe in the coming weeks.After a campaign event with the first lady on Friday, McAuliffe will welcome Stacey Abrams, a Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia in 2018 who has gained national prominence, and former President Barack Obama. Biden, too, is expected to hit the campaign trail as the end of the race nears.Abrams, who is heading to Norfolk on Sunday to lead a \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d event, \u201cwill bring out the hardcore Democrats,\u201d said David Ramadan, an adjunct professor at the Schar School at George Mason University and a resident scholar at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\u201cBoth campaigns are waging \u2018base\u2019 elections,\u201d where larger numbers of entrenched supporters show up to vote, said Stephen Farnsworth, the director of the University of Mary Washington\u2019s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. He called this the logical approach for both campaigns, where most voters identify on one side or the other.\u201cThere\u2019s not that much persuasion going on,\u201d he said.Whether Biden, who has lost ground among voters in national and statewide polls, can provide a boost to McAuliffe isn\u2019t clear. The former governor recently said on a call with supporters that \u201cheadwinds from Washington\u201d were hampering him in the race.Biden faces a logjam in Congress over his legislative agenda that lawmakers said could be hurting McAuliffe by failing to make the case that a Democratic administration can get things done.Meanwhile, independent voters are unlikely to boost Democrats as they did in 2020, analysts said.Independents last year gave Biden a margin of 10 percentage points, but they are split between McAuliffe and Youngkin, said Ramadan.A former GOP member of the Virginia House, Ramadan explained that the number of independent voters engaged in the race is smaller in a presidential off-year. Meanwhile, likely voters are more partisan than the presidential electorate.The key for either side is to stir their supporters.\u201cIf there\u2019s evidence of a vast American middle waiting to be motivated, it is pretty hard to find,\u201d Farnsworth said.Ramadan, who has endorsed McAuliffe, said the Democrat \u201conly wins if the base comes out.\u201dThe county to watch is Fairfax County, Kenney said.\u201cIf Democrats win Fairfax 2-to-1, it\u2019s gonna be a long night for Republicans,\u201d he said.But if Republicans win 55% of the vote in Fairfax County, \u201cbuckle up,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very long night for the Democrats.\u201dThe race has drawn national attention, with Trump providing a vocal endorsement of Youngkin and calling into a rally this week to support him. Each candidate has also leveraged issues of national interest to stir support.But Youngkin\u2019s advances in the polls are less about the race he\u2019s running and more to do with his Democratic opponent, Kenney said.\u201cMost of these are self-inflicted wounds from the Biden administration. So, Republican fortunes have effectively risen on Biden\u2019s missteps,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cNationally, this is not a state that was thought to be red anymore \u2014 the Republicans effectively conceded the battlefield.\u201dLast year, Biden won the state by 10 percentage points against former President Donald Trump.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\u201cIt was a 55-45 romp,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cIn 2017, we forfeited 15 seats in the General Assembly.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThis was a state that Democrats believed they were going to hold for the next 20 years.

A non-profit ethics watchdog on Friday called for a probe into whether White House press secretary Jen Psaki violated federal law with an apparent endorsement from the White House podium of a Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, said it filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), asking that it investigate whether Psaki violated the Hatch Act by advocating for the election of Terry McAuliffe.McAuliffe, who served as Virginia governor from 2014 to 2018, is up against Republican Glenn Youngkin in the Nov. 2 election. Polls show it as a close contest.The Hatch Act of 1939 limits the political campaigning activities of federal employees, except the president and vice president.During a media briefing on Thursday, Psaki said: \"We're going to do everything we can to help former Governor McAuliffe, and we believe in the agenda he's representing.\"CREW said it appeared Psaki used her official authority or influence to affect the results of the election.\"OSC should commence an immediate investigation into the conduct described in this letter and take any appropriate disciplinary action against Ms. Psaki,\" the complaint read.During the Trump administration, CREW logged complaints against multiple White House officials. One complaint against Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway led to an OSC recommendation that she be removed from federal service.In an accompanying release, CREW President Noah Bookbinder said Psaki's potential violation paled in comparison to \"the outrageous offenses of the Trump administration.\"Asked about the complaint in an interview with CNN on Friday, Psaki said she would be more careful next time.\"Words certainly matter,\" she said.(Reporting by Tyler Clifford and Kanishka Singh; Writing by Tyler Clifford; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Aurora Ellis)", "preprocessed": "tyler clifford reuter non profit ethic watchdog friday call probe whether white hous press secretari jen psaki violat feder law appar endors white hous podium democrat candid governor virginia citizen respons ethic washington crew said file complaint offic special counsel osc ask investig whether psaki violat hatch act advoc elect terri mcauliff mcauliff serv virginia governor republican glenn youngkin nov elect poll show close contest hatch act limit polit campaign activ feder employe except presid vice presid medium brief thursday psaki said go everyth help former governor mcauliff believ agenda repres crew said appear psaki use offici author influenc affect result elect osc commenc immedi investig conduct describ letter take appropri disciplinari action m psaki complaint read trump administr crew log complaint multipl white hous offici one complaint trump advis kellyann conway led osc recommend remov feder servic accompani releas crew presid noah bookbind said psaki potenti violat pale comparison outrag offens trump administr ask complaint interview cnn friday psaki said would care next time word certainli matter said report tyler clifford kanishka singh write tyler clifford edit tim ahmann aurora elli"}, {"title": "Snail pace threatens Biden spending plans", "author": "Naomi Lim", "date": "October 16, 2021, 7:00 AM", "body": "The slow pace of President Joe Biden's social welfare and climate spending package has gifted Republicans with more time to criticize it before the 2022 midterm elections.And not only can Republicans scrutinize the package's likely $2 trillion price tag, they can ding Democrats for being in stereotypical disarray.BIDEN TRIES TO AVOID BECOMING TERRY MCAULIFFE'S ALBATROSS IN HIGHLY WATCHED VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACEBiden's \"Build Back Broke\" agenda is \"a socialist's dream come true,\" according to Republican National Committee spokeswoman Emma Vaughn.\"Americans do not want trillions of dollars in inflationary spending and the largest tax increase in decades, which is why voters will soundly reject Biden's empty promises, and elect Republicans up and down the ballot come November 2022,\" she said.Former Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a one-time Tea Party Caucus chairman, described the Biden administration as \"looking to be almost as feckless\" as the president himself.\"Perhaps the only [thing] worse politically than foisting their massive Democrat socialism package onto America is Biden\u2019s inability to get anything done,\" he said. \"Inflation is spiking, Christmas is in jeopardy, the economy is faltering, the border [is] falling apart, and the legislative highlight for President Biden is designating a memorial trail route.\"One Democratic strategist suggested Republicans are not experiencing the same success they did during former President Barack Obama's first summer when the Tea Party hit him hard over his healthcare reform proposals. That is partly because it is unclear what will be in Biden's spending package, the source told the Washington Examiner. Both sides are having trouble defining the bill, but that is not a problem since the midterm elections are more than a year away, the person said.The Democrat's comments are simultaneously backed and undermined by a CBS poll published this week that found more respondents knew about the cost of Biden's spending package rather than its possible contents. While a majority approved of the measure, only a third told pollsters they believed it would help them or the economy directly.Story continuesRonald Reagan biographer Craig Shirley disagreed with the Democrat's 2009 comparison. He called Biden \"a weakling,\" adding \"it is always best to attack your enemy when they are disorganized.\" But as former President Donald Trump continues to exert influence over Republicans, Shirley warned they may not have \"adequate generals.\"\"The Right has good ground troops but has no Douglas MacArthur leading them,\" he said, extending the metaphor. \"You can\u2019t beat something with nothing. You need a countervailing force. The GOP lacks both in the face of a weak president and a weak argument. The Right has 'consultants' and 'talking heads,' and that is woefully weak.\"Some Democrats have vented about their own standard-bearer's leadership. Centrist Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has received flak from liberal colleagues for not sharing what her priorities are for Biden's spending package, but select Democrats have similar complaints about Biden. The president, they say, is trying not to alienate important constituencies by signaling his support for cutting their favored programs. Those Democrats have downplayed the package in their districts and states, preferring instead to promote the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal, whose passage has been delayed by House liberals hoping for leverage amid spending negotiations with an evenly divided Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has given talks an Oct. 31 deadline.White House press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged this week that \"time is not unlimited\" for spending package discussions. Biden and his aides are imploring lawmakers \"to find a way to unify around a package that can deliver results to the American people,\" she told reporters.\"He's pressing members to move forward. He's been very engaged over the last several days, as he has been throughout, as have members of our senior team,\" she said.But one Democratic operative insisted \"it matters a lot more that we get these bills done than when we get them done.\"CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\"Once we get these bills passed we\u2019re going to be able to go to voters in 2022, 2023, and 2024, and show voters how Democrats lowered costs, made it easier to be a middle-class family, and made the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share,\" the staffer said.Washington Examiner VideosTags: News, Biden Administration, Biden, White House, Joe Biden, InfrastructureOriginal Author: Naomi LimOriginal Location: Snail pace threatens Biden spending plans", "preprocessed": "slow pace presid joe biden social welfar climat spend packag gift republican time critic midterm elect republican scrutin packag like trillion price tag ding democrat stereotyp disarray biden tri avoid becom terri mcauliff albatross highli watch virginia governor racebiden build back broke agenda socialist dream come true accord republican nation committe spokeswoman emma vaughn american want trillion dollar inflationari spend largest tax increas decad voter soundli reject biden empti promis elect republican ballot come novemb said former kansa rep tim huelskamp one time tea parti caucu chairman describ biden administr look almost feckless presid perhap thing wors polit foist massiv democrat social packag onto america biden inabl get anyth done said inflat spike christma jeopardi economi falter border fall apart legisl highlight presid biden design memori trail rout one democrat strategist suggest republican experienc success former presid barack obama first summer tea parti hit hard healthcar reform propos partli unclear biden spend packag sourc told washington examin side troubl defin bill problem sinc midterm elect year away person said democrat comment simultan back undermin cb poll publish week found respond knew cost biden spend packag rather possibl content major approv measur third told pollster believ would help economi directli stori continuesronald reagan biograph craig shirley disagre democrat comparison call biden weakl ad alway best attack enemi disorgan former presid donald trump continu exert influenc republican shirley warn may adequ gener right good ground troop dougla macarthur lead said extend metaphor beat someth noth need countervail forc gop lack face weak presid weak argument right consult talk head woefulli weak democrat vent standard bearer leadership centrist arizona sen kyrsten sinema receiv flak liber colleagu share prioriti biden spend packag select democrat similar complaint biden presid say tri alien import constitu signal support cut favor program democrat downplay packag district state prefer instead promot trillion bipartisan infrastructur deal whose passag delay hous liber hope leverag amid spend negoti evenli divid senat hous speaker nanci pelosi given talk oct deadlin white hous press secretari jen psaki acknowledg week time unlimit spend packag discus biden aid implor lawmak find way unifi around packag deliv result american peopl told report press member move forward engag last sever day throughout member senior team said one democrat oper insist matter lot get bill done get done click read washington examin get bill pas go abl go voter show voter democrat lower cost made easier middl class famili made wealthi corpor pay fair share staffer said washington examin videostag news biden administr biden white hous joe biden infrastructureorigin author naomi limorigin locat snail pace threaten biden spend plan"}, {"title": "Delicate dance for Trump, Youngkin in campaign's final weeks", "author": "Via AP news wire", "date": "October 15, 2021, 9:36 PM", "body": "Virginia Governor Youngkin (ASSOCIATED PRESS)When Donald Trump rallied Republicans this week to vote for Glenn Youngkin for governor in Virginia, the former president called in to a rally of diehard supporters. That may be the closest he gets to campaigning in the most closely-watched election of 2021.While schedules could evolve in the final weeks of the race, the two are not expected to campaign together in person before Election Day next month.\u201cIs Trump going to come to Virginia? Yes. But it will be after the election for a victory rally,\u201d said conservative talk show host John Fredericks, who served as Trump's campaign chairman in the state and also organized Wednesday\u2019s event. Youngkin\u2019s campaign confirmed Friday it does not have any plans for surrogates to join him in the race's final stretch.The dynamic reflects the complex balancing act between Trump and Youngkin and could emerge as a model for other Republicans who face competitive campaigns in 2022. The former president remains the most popular figure in GOP politics and is eager to remain engaged. Youngkin needs Trump's supporters to show up to the polls and can't risk giving the former president a reason to turn on him in the race\u2019s final weeks. But he must also avoid being tied too closely to someone who is unpopular in crucial swaths of the state, particularly the populated suburbs that surround Washington and Richmond.It's a delicate balancing act for Youngkin, who is locked in a tight race with Democrat Terry McAuliffe and steered clear of the Wednesday event. In addition to Fredericks, the rally was headlined by longtime Trump strategist Steve Bannon who could soon find himself charged with contempt for refusing to cooperate with a House committee investigating the violent Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. And it drew outrage after attendees recited the pledge of allegiance to a flag the emcee said had been flown that day, a move Youngkin later criticized.While the former president remains the most powerful force in the party nine months after leaving office, he lost Virginia by 10 points in 2020 and is viewed favorably by just 44% of likely voters in the state, according to a recent Fox News poll.Story continuesIf Trump were to hold a rally in the state, \u201cit would be a disaster for Youngkin,\u201d said Bob Holsworth, a longtime local political analyst in the state. \u201cThis is a person who lost by 10 points in Virginia, lost in a landslide. He\u2019s extremely unpopular in Virginia. ... The more he shows up and he more he participates, the worse off it is for Youngkin.\"That risk was underscored by the reaction to Wednesday's event, where Trump praised Youngkin as \u201ca great gentleman,\u201d while spreading lies about the 2020 election.Democrats immediately pounced, condemning what they labeled \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s insurrectionist rally.\" McAuliffe's campaign cut an ad featuring Trump\u2019s praise for Youngkin, while McAuliffe held a press conference to tear into his opponent, both broadly for his focus on \u201cdangerous conspiracy theories\u201d and for his initial silence on the event itself.Trump, for his part, also has little to gain by spending much more political capital on the race. If Youngkin wins, Trump is sure to try to take credit, citing his participation in Wednesday's rally, his May endorsement, and any future get out the vote efforts. But if Youngkin loses, Trump can blame him for not aligning himself more closely with the former president.Indeed, Trump recently had warned the candidate about straying too far during an interview with Fredericks.\u201cThe only guys that win are the guys that embrace the MAGA movement,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they try and go down a railroad track, you know, \u2018Hey, oh yeah, sure, I love it, love it. Oh yeah, I love Trump, love Trump, OK, let\u2019s go, next subject.\u2019 When they do that, they never win. They never win. They have to embrace it.\u201dWhile Youngkin's campaign hasn\u2019t featured many big-name surrogates at his political events, McAuliffe has been summoning Democratic star power. President Joe Biden has already campaigned with McAuliffe and his campaign told The Associated Press this week that the president will return before the Nov. 2 vote. First lady Jill Biden appeared with McAuliffe at a rally Friday and former President Barack Obama will campaign with him next week.Trump spokespeople did not respond to questions about the race, and Youngkin\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about Trump.Youngkin has aimed his pitch more toward moderate and independent voters since winning his party\u2019s primary. During that campaign, Youngkin declined to say whether Biden was fairly elected. He has since said he believes he was \u2014 and that he does not believe there was significant fraud last November.Instead of following in the mold of other blue-state Republican governors like Maryland\u2019s Larry Hogan and Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Youngkin has run on a solidly conservative set of platforms, embracing some GOP culture war issues and promising to help reject the \u201cleft liberal progressive agenda\u201d he says is shaping Virginia.After mostly pivoting away from his focus on election integrity in the nomination contest, he\u2019s centered campaign appearances and ads on issues like crime, taxes and school choice.Democrats have criticized him, though, for recent remarks about auditing the state\u2019s voting machines and for campaigning with state Sen. Amanda Chase, a prominent promoter of election falsehoods who\u2019s garnered the nickname \u201cTrump in heels.\u201dYoungkin has also previously said Trump \u201crepresents so much of why I\u2019m running.\u201d\u201cWhat Youngkin is trying to do is he\u2019s attempting to maintain the MAGA base while absorbing the suburban defectors from the Democrats. And that\u2019s tough,\u201d said Holsworth,Fredericks said it was a winning strategy.\u201cHere\u2019s why Glenn Youngkin is going to win: We\u2019re holding the Trump base together by a thread,\" he said. \u201dGlenn Youngkin and this campaign has never abandoned the core principles that are important to Trump voters, not one day.\"Former Virginia governor, U.S. ambassador and GOP presidential candidate Jim Gilmore said Youngkin had done a good job of keeping the race tightly focused on his candidacy.\u201cI think that nationalizing this campaign is not helpful to either of the candidates,\u201d he said.\u201cGlenn\u2019s got to be his own man\u201d and \u201crun his own\u201d race, agreed former U.S. Rep. Tom Davis, who represented northern Virginia\u2019s 11th Congressional District for 14 years.Davis said he thinks Virginia voters are more concerned about Biden, whose approval rating has slumped, than Trump. People voted for Biden \u201cto get Donald Trump out of their living room,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t vote for all this stuff that Biden\u2019s bringing with him. And I think they\u2019re going to pump the brakes.\"Several polls released since mid-September show a competitive race between McAuliffe and Youngkin. Some, including a recent poll by Fox News, suggest McAuliffe may have a slight advantage, though Youngkin remains within striking distance and some voters for both candidates said they may still change their minds.__Colvin reported from New York.", "preprocessed": "virginia governor youngkin associ press donald trump ralli republican week vote glenn youngkin governor virginia former presid

"Julia Ainsley", "date": "October 15, 2021, 12:01 AM", "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After having lost a legal battle, the Biden administration tentatively plans a mid-November restart of a Trump-era policy that forces migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration court hearings, according to a court filing late Thursday.President Joe Biden had ended the Trump administration's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy when he took office this year, saying it was inhumane because of the violence migrants faced waiting in Mexico for their court hearings.Texas and Missouri sued the Biden administration in April over the suspension of Remain in Mexico, which is formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP. In August, a federal judge in Texas ordered the Biden administration to reinstate the policy pending the outcome of the suit.The Biden administration fought the order but lost in federal appeals court and in the Supreme Court and then said it would comply with the court's order.Senior administration officials told reporters Thursday that under the updated Biden administration version of Remain in Mexico, immigrants will get court dates set no more than six months in the future and will attend hearings with immigration judges in one of 10 courts to be set up near Brownsville and Laredo, Texas.Video: Women and girls being murdered in record numbers in MexicoThe plans to implement the revised policy, however, would be put on hold if the Biden administration ultimately wins the lawsuit filed by Texas and Missouri.Mexico will also have the power to amend the policy, the officials said, and the administration has been consulting with it about the details.\"There are certain issues Mexico has also raised about the prior implementation\" of Remain in Mexico, one of the officials said. \"Any reimplementation would have to take those into account.\"In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said: \"As noted in the declaration filed on Thursday, DHS is taking necessary steps to comply with the court order, which requires us to reimplement MPP in good faith. We are working to do so, despite our appeal of the court's order, including, for example, by issuing contracts to rebuild temporary immigration-hearing facilities near the Southwest border.Story continues\"Significantly, Mexico is a sovereign nation that must make an independent decision to accept the return of individuals without status in Mexico as part of any reimplementation of MPP,\" the statement said. \"Discussions with the Government of Mexico concerning when and how MPP will be reimplemented are ongoing.\"Remain in Mexico, which the Trump administration started in January 2019, created a population boom in migrant camps on the Mexican side of the border. Human rights organizations documented hundreds of kidnappings, rapes and assaults of migrants who were waiting in the sprawling camps for their asylum hearings.The Biden administration has continued to implement \u2014 and defend in another court case \u2014 Covid-19 restrictions known as Title 42, which push immigrants back into Mexico or deport them to their home countries without giving them court dates. The officials said that the administration will continue to use that policy and that only immigrants who are not subject to Title 42 \u2014 for a variety of reasons \u2014 would be subject to Remain in Mexico.", "preprocessed": "washington lost legal battl biden administr tent plan mid novemb restart trump era polici forc migrant seek asylum wait mexico u immigr court hear accord court file late thursday presid joe biden end trump administr remain mexico polici took offic year say inhuman violenc migrant face wait mexico court hear texa missouri su biden administr april suspens remain mexico formal known migrant protect protocol mpp august feder judg texa order biden administr reinstat polici pend outcom suit biden administr fought order lost feder appeal court suprem court said would compli court order senior administr offici told report thursday updat biden administr version remain mexico immigr get court date set six month futur attend hear immigr judg one court set near brownsvil laredo texa video woman girl murder record number mexicoth plan implement revis polici howev would put hold biden administr ultim win lawsuit file texa missouri mexico also power amend polici offici said administr consult detail certain issu mexico also rais prior implement remain mexico one offici said reimplement would take account statement spokesperson depart homeland secur said note declar file thursday dh take necessari step compli court order requir u reimplement mpp good faith work despit appeal court order includ exampl issu contract rebuild temporari immigr hear facil near southwest border stori continu significantli mexico sovereign nation must make independ decis accept return individu without statu mexico part reimplement mpp statement said discus govern mexico concern mpp reimplement ongo remain mexico trump administr start januari creat popul boom migrant camp mexican side border human right organ document hundr kidnap rape assault migrant wait sprawl camp asylum hear biden administr continu implement defend anoth court case covid restrict known titl push immigr back mexico deport home countri without give court date offici said administr continu use polici immigr subject titl varieti reason would subject remain mexico"}, {"title": "Biden: 'We're not going to get $3.5 trillion' in budget reconciliation", "author": "Christian Datoc", "date": "October 15, 2021, 2:58 PM", "body": "President Joe Biden said Friday that his social safety net budget reconciliation package won't hit the $3.5 trillion price tag outlined by Democratic leaders over the summer.His comments, delivered during remarks at a Connecticut child care center, mark the first time the president appeared to concede fully that he would need to reduce the scope of the bill in order to secure votes from centrist Democratic Sens.

The audio, which was recorded on a hidden student cell phone, partially revealed how a discussion on race led to the teacher, Norman Grueneich, making the offensive remarks.Parents and community activists were outraged when a classroom recording exposed a Texas teacher for making racial remarks. (Photo: KHOU 11/YouTube)\u201cI mean, if there\u2019s a word that you\u2019re not supposed to say, why are you saying it?\u201d questions a student in the audio recording.Grueneich, who is a white male, responded with, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

We regret that our students were impacted by this language, and if any of them would like to talk to any of our counselors, we will make them available.

Expectations weren't just high, they were basically in orbit.When Adele dropped the deeply personal and emotional ballad (it's all about her feelings as she was going through her divorce from ex Simon Konecki, with whom she shares son Angelo), the response from fans and critics was pretty much a universal outpouring of heart eye emojis, but not everyone loved the track, apparently. Specifically, a few members of Adele's inner circle were basically like \"meh\" when they heard the earliest pieces of the song.\"Well, they loved it,\" she revealed during an interview on the BBC 1 Radio Breakfast show with Greg James on Friday. \"I was saying the other day that I sent a snippet of me singing it as I was writing it to three of my closest friends here and one didn't like it, the other one was like, 'Well, yeah, maybe, keep trying though,' and the other one was, 'I'm busy working.' So that was the perfect response for me.\" In spite of the, \"eh, keep trying\" response, Adele added that her friends were unanimously impressed by one aspect of the song.\"People, they loved my patience in it. I'm such a knee-jerk person,\" she added. \"I'll be like, 'I don't like it, forget it!' I'm like that with my music. I'm like that with just things I want to do. I'm like that with my feelings and stuff and it was, I think it was clear to them in the lyrics that I've bided my time and I wasn't reacting to a reaction or anything like that. It was just a feeling that I had stirred on for a while.\"In the same interview, Adele also got candid about the emotional experience of writing\u2014and then actually recording\u2014the song.\"Normally I'm very not confrontational, but you can initiate something and be like, 'Hang on a minute, go easy on me!' Like, bear with me while I try to find my feet in a situation,\" she said. \"There's something that's really hopeful about it as well as sad.

They were going off what they've been hearing and reading on the internet,\" Mike Mitchem, Kevin's brother, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Mike did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Data from the CDC has shown that Pfizer and Moderna's two-shot vaccine series are highly effective at preventing COVID-19 infections. Approximately 61.9% of Virginia's population is fully vaccinated, compared to 56.8% of the U.S. population that is fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.Kevin, 48, became ill and was told to rest at home after he tested positive for COVID-19, Mike told the Times-Dispatch.

But even if it did, experts say the president doesn't have that authority.Story continuesRosen said only a general court-martial, the military\u2019s highest level trial court, can sentence service members to dishonorable discharge. If a service member is found guilty in a trial, the court-martial is still not obligated to dishonorably discharge them.\u00a0Commanding General of Fort Gordon and Cyber Center of Excellence Paul Stanton stops by a mass vaccination event at Eisenhower Medical Center on Friday morning, Oct. 1, 2021. All active duty military have to get vaccinated by Dec. 15, 2021.Dwight Stirling, CEO of the Center for Law and Military Policy think tank, said in an email that a service member\u2019s refusal to get vaccinated would likely result in \"adverse administrative action.\" That could include: a written reprimand, a derogatory comment in a performance evaluation, a demotion or \u2013 \u201cin the most extreme instances\u201d \u2013 an involuntary discharge.There are five types of discharge a service member can receive upon separation from the military, Stirling said: honorable, general, other-than-honorable, bad conduct and dishonorable. The last two can only be issued via conviction by a court-martial.\u00a0Stirling said while it's not impossible for a service member to face a court-martial for refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine, it's unlikely.\u201cIn the unlikely event that a service member is involuntarily discharged via administrative action for refusal to take the vaccine, he would most (likely) receive one of the first three types of discharge, most likely an other-than-honorable,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cAn other-than-honorable discharge, while not something any service member wants as it is analogous to being fired, is a far cry from a dishonorable discharge, which is analogous to a felony conviction.\u201dFact check: Defense firm General Dynamics has not yet announced vaccine mandateLindsay Cohn, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, agreed it is unlikely troops would be court-martialed for refusing the vaccine, unless there were \"exacerbating circumstances\" \u2013 like a service member trying to convince others to disobey.\u00a0\u00a0\"The military tends to prefer to resolve issues at the lowest effective level, and will elevate to court-martial only if they have no other choice,\" Cohn said in an email. \"Could the president order them to court-martial everyone who refused the vaccine? Yes, but there is no good reason to do so.\"A Pentagon spokesperson told USA TODAY in an emailed statement that the claim in the social media posts is false. USA TODAY reached out to the White House for comment.Service members still have time to get vaccinatedDespite the Defense Department's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, service members still have at least a few weeks to receive their first shot.In mid-September, the Army released a service-wide directive on vaccine requirements. Active-duty troops have until Dec. 15 to get the shot, while soldiers in the Army National Guard and Reserve have until June 30, 2022.Meanwhile, Military.com reported Air Force service members must be vaccinated by Nov. 2, while Air National Guard members must be vaccinated by Dec. 2. Marines and sailors have until Nov. 28, while reserve component service members have until Dec. 28 to get the shots.Marine Corps Capt. Andrew Wood told USA TODAY that, as of Oct. 2, there had been no Marines court-martialed for failing to get fully vaccinated.\u201cMarines who refuse the vaccine today may choose to be vaccinated tomorrow,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cEvery effort is made to provide service members with accurate information regarding the vaccine and Marines are encouraged to discuss any hesitancy they may have with qualified medical providers.\u201dService members can seek exemptions for a number of reasons, including religious objections and health issues. Those exemptions can be temporary or permanent, the Associated Press reported.Fact check: Post tying Pfizer's Q2 earnings to vaccine 'risks' is falseLt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll, chief of media relations for the Coast Guard, said the Coast Guard was not directed to dishonorably discharge members who refuse to take the vaccine. However, it is considering \"a number of administrative and disciplinary options\" for those who refuse the shot.About 22% of service members unvaccinatedRose's blog post claims \u201c46% of troops\u201d \u2013 or about 600,000 active-duty service members \u2013 have declined to get the the COVID-19 vaccine. But those numbers aren't quite right.\u00a0According to June data from the Defense Department, there are about 2.15 million members of the U.S. military. That includes 1.38 million active-duty service members and 770,000 in the National Guard and reserves.The Pentagon\u2019s COVID-19 data shows about 1.3 million service members were fully vaccinated as of Sept. 30, with an additional 380,197 who had received one shot. That means about 60% of troops were fully vaccinated and about 78% were at least half vaccinated.Bradley Sharp, of Saratoga, New York, gets the Johnson & Johnson vaccine from registered nurse Stephanie Wagner in New York.About 22% of service members have not been vaccinated at all \u2013 not 46%, as the post claims.Lt. Cdr. Patricia Kreuzberger of the Navy said that, as of Oct. 6, 84% of Navy service members were fully immunized and 94% had received at least one dose of the vaccine.\u00a0\u00a0The Army declined to comment for this fact check. USA TODAY reached out to the two other military branches for comment.Our rating: FalseBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Biden ordered dishonorable discharges for troops refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. The Biden administration did not order the Pentagon to dishonorably discharge unvaccinated troops, and the president doesn\u2019t have the authority to do so.\u00a0Fewer than 46% of U.S. troops are unvaccinated. Service members have at least a few weeks to get their shots, and if they don't, experts say involuntary discharges are unlikely.Our fact-check sources:PolitiFact, Oct. 1, Biden hasn\u2019t ordered dishonorable discharges for vaccine refusers in military, as viral post claimedDepartment of Defense, Aug. 24, MEMORANDUM FOR SENIOR PENTAGON LEADERSHIP COMMANDERS OF THE CO MBA TANT COMMANDS DEFENSE AGENCY AND DOD FIELD ACTIVITY DIRECTORSU.S. Senator for Texas Ted Cruz, Sept. 21, Sens.

according to a report.China had made \"astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than U.S. officials realized,\" two people told the Financial Times Saturday, with another source adding he or she was unsure how China was able to accomplish it.The country has tested 79 Long March 2C rockets that carry the missiles so far, according to the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. Five people with knowledge of the launch told the outlet that the missile flew in low orbit before going down toward its target, which it missed by 24 miles.ARMY CHIEF PUSHES BACK ON FORMER SOFTWARE CHIEF\u2019S CLAIM US LOST THE TECHNOLOGY BATTLE TO CHINAJohn Kirby, the press secretary for the Department of Defense, said the United States sees China as the No. 1 \"pacing challenge\" as the two countries work toward developing hypersonic weapons that travel at five times the speed of sound.\"We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue, capabilities that only increase tensions in the region and beyond,\" Kirby said.But a spokesman for China, Liu Pengyu, said the country has no global strategy or plans of military operations.\"We are not at all interested in having an arms race with other countries,\" Liu said. \"In contrast, the U.S. has in recent years been fabricating excuses like 'the China threat' to justify its arms expansion and development of hypersonic weapons. This has directly intensified the arms race in this category and severely undermined global strategic stability.\"CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINERA hypersonic missile would be slower than a ballistic missile, but the weapon has the maneuverability that ballistic missiles lack, which helps them dodge and become harder for enemies to track.Story continuesThe Washington Examiner has reached out to the Pentagon for comment but did not hear back by the time of publication.Washington Examiner VideosTags: News, China, Space, National Security, Foreign Policy, Technology, Missile TestOriginal Author: Misty SeveriOriginal Location: China surprised US officials with August missiles test: Report", "preprocessed": "china surpris u offici test new hyperson missil august went around globe made way toward intend target accord report china made astound progress hyperson weapon far advanc u offici realiz two peopl told financi time saturday anoth sourc ad unsur china abl accomplish countri test long march c rocket carri missil far accord china academi launch vehicl technolog five peopl knowledg launch told outlet missil flew low orbit go toward target miss mile armi chief push back former softwar chief claim u lost technolog battl chinajohn kirbi press secretari depart defens said unit state see china pace challeng two countri work toward develop hyperson weapon travel five time speed sound made clear concern militari capabl china continu pursu capabl increas tension region beyond kirbi said spokesman china liu pengyu said countri global strategi plan militari oper interest arm race countri liu said contrast u recent year fabric excus like china threat justifi arm expans develop hyperson weapon directli intensifi arm race categori sever undermin global strateg stabil click read washington examinera hyperson missil would slower ballist missil weapon maneuver ballist missil lack help dodg becom harder enemi track stori continuesth washington examin reach pentagon comment hear back time public washington examin videostag news china space nation secur foreign polici technolog missil testorigin author misti severiorigin locat china surpris u offici august missil test report"}, {"title": "A top GOP committee sent a message accusing supporters who hadn't donated of being traitors: 'You abandoned Trump.'", "author": "Erin Snodgrass", "date": "October 14, 2021, 11:29 PM", "body": "The National Republican Congressional Committee sent an antagonistic message to donors this month.The group accused those who had not yet contributed of being a \"traitor\" and abandoning Trump.Some Trump advisers told The Washington Post they were livid with the framing of the message.A top GOP committee dedicated to electing Republicans to the House of Representatives is taking an adversarial approach to some of its recent fundraising attempts.\u00a0The National Republican Congressional Committee sent a fundraising message this month threatening supporters who had not yet donated, calling them a \"traitor,\" The Washington Post reported.\u00a0\"You abandoned Trump,\" a text version of the message said. \"We were told you were a tried & true, lifelong patriot.\"\"But when Trump said he'd run for President if we took back the House from Nancy Pelosi...You did nothing.

On Thursday, Trump published a statement to his political action committee website, Save America, conveying the threat.\"If we don't solve the Presidential Election Fraud of 2020 (which we have thoroughly and conclusively documented), Republicans will not be voting in '22 or '24. It is the single most important thing for Republicans to do,\" the statement said.Official audits and election experts have concluded there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and the Department of Homeland Security declared the election the \"most secure in American history.\"One elections expert told Insider that the former president's ultimatum is \"mostly a power play,\" and Trump, in addition to several other senior Republican leaders, has expressed confidence that the party will be able to retake Congress come 2022.\u00a0Read the original article on Business Insider", "preprocessed": "nation republican congression committe sent antagonist messag donor month group accus yet contribut traitor abandon trump trump advis told washington post livid frame messag top gop committe dedic elect republican hous repres take adversari approach recent fundrais attempt nation republican congression committe sent fundrais messag month threaten support yet donat call traitor washington post report abandon trump text version messag said told tri true lifelong patriot trump said run presid took back hous nanci pelosi noth trump wrong statement ask andrew solend andrewsolend octob messag continu offer recipi final chanc prove loyalti el brand desert statement said donor minut respond accord post trump advis furiou frame email call put worri could alien support trump continu hint presidenti run tone total inappropri one anonym advisor told outlet committe messag spokesperson trump organ immedi respond insid request comment former presid though oust offic still hold sway republican parti gop strategist eager regain control washington use trump sphere power name recognit target dedic base hope prompt republican voter turnout larg enough return congress gop stori continuesth messag come even trump publicli issu threat gop lawmak tell back ongo lie unfound elect fraud el republican refus vote thursday trump publish statement polit action committe websit save america convey threat solv presidenti elect fraud thoroughli conclus document republican vote singl import thing republican statement said offici audit elect expert conclud widespread fraud elect depart homeland secur declar elect secur american histori one elect expert told insid former presid ultimatum mostli power play trump addit sever senior republican leader express confid parti abl retak congress come read origin articl busi insid"}, {"title": "The Actress Who Played Allison in \u2018Hocus Pocus' Basically Just Confirmed That She's Not in the Sequel", "author": "Kayleigh Roberts, Adrianna Freedman", "date": "October 16, 2021, 1:39 PM", "body": "Photo credit: DisneyNineties kids, we need to have a screamfest right about now.

I would love to do the sequel. It would be so much fun. I think there's just a different storyline with younger people, but why can't we all come back in some way?\"Story continuesThe movie takes place in modern times. The Hollywood Reporter gave further details on what the sequel will be about, and the premise is just as darkly comedic as the first one. According to the production, three young women find themselves accidentally summoning the Sanderson sisters to modern-day Salem. Just like the first movie\u2019s protagonists, the new trio has to stop the witches from wreaking havoc in the 21st century.Director Anne Fletcher told THR that she\u2019s thrilled to be bringing the iconic witches back to their fans\u2019 lives. \u201cWe should be laughing every day, and there is so much fun to be had with these three unbelievable women playing delicious characters from such a beloved film,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cI am so grateful to be able to play a part in bringing these witches back to life, and to be working with my friends at Disney again makes it all the more special.

Illustrated | Getty Images, iStock, Library of Congress The left-leaning group Data For Progress on Thursday released genuinely brutal poll numbers for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), whose very public role in holding up President Biden's agenda is clearly not wearing well with her state's primary electorate.The survey of likely voters for her 2024 Democratic Senate primary showed just 25 percent approval for Sinema's performance in office, as opposed to 85 percent for Arizona's other Democratic senator, Mark Kelly, and President Biden himself. Tellingly, she trailed all four of her hypothetical primary opponents by 29 points or more.The brewing revolt of the Arizona Democratic electorate should terrify Sinema \u2014 assuming that she has any interest in being re-elected as a member of the Democratic Party. Unlike her partner in obstruction, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Sinema is not the only Democrat who could plausibly be elected to statewide office in her state. And her troubles suggest that the stalwart Democrats who vote in primary elections are yearning for the kind of party discipline former President Donald Trump imposed on wavering Republicans.Sinema's dreadful numbers, in fact, look a lot like those of former Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in the 2018 election cycle. One of the most prominent Trump critics in the Senate both before and after Trump's election, Flake trailed ultraconservative Republican Kelli Ward by 27 points in a hypothetical primary, and boasted the exact same 25 percent approval number among likely GOP primary voters (albeit much closer to Election Day than Sinema is now). Seeing the writing on the wall, Flake chose to retire rather than face a near-certain primary drubbing.Unlike Flake, a frequent recipient of Trump's juvenile invective, Sinema has barely received any public criticism from Biden, suggesting Arizona Democrats resent her largely for opposing popular policies like paid family leave and expanded Medicare benefits. And unless she relents and helps craft a social spending bill acceptable to all factions of her party, she's likely to follow Flake's path to political oblivion.Story continuesYou may also likeThe American 'Great Resignation' by the numbersMadonna makes Jimmy Fallon sweat, remove coat in 'disturbed' interviewQueen Elizabeth caught expressing irritation with world leaders who talk but 'don't do' on climate change", "preprocessed": "kyrsten sinema illustr getti imag istock librari congress left lean group data progress thursday releas genuin brutal poll number sen kyrsten sinema ariz whose public role hold presid biden agenda clearli wear well state primari elector survey like voter democrat senat primari show percent approv sinema perform offic oppos percent arizona democrat senat mark kelli presid biden tellingli trail four hypothet primari oppon point brew revolt arizona democrat elector terrifi sinema assum interest elect member democrat parti unlik partner obstruct sen joe manchin w va sinema democrat could plausibl elect statewid offic state troubl suggest stalwart democrat vote primari elect yearn kind parti disciplin former presid donald trump impos waver republican sinema dread number fact look lot like former arizona republican sen jeff flake elect cycl one promin trump critic senat trump elect flake trail ultraconserv republican kelli ward point hypothet primari boast exact percent approv number among like gop primari voter albeit much closer elect day sinema see write wall flake chose retir rather face near certain primari drub unlik flake frequent recipi trump juvenil invect sinema bare receiv public critic biden suggest arizona democrat resent larg oppos popular polici like paid famili leav expand medicar benefit unless relent help craft social spend bill accept faction parti like follow flake path polit oblivion stori continuesy may also liketh american great resign numbersmadonna make jimmi fallon sweat remov coat disturb interviewqueen elizabeth caught express irrit world leader talk climat chang"}, {"title": "Trump allies Lin Wood and Marjorie Taylor Greene exchange right-wing insults in a public feud", "author": "Alia Shoaib", "date": "October 16, 2021, 6:04 AM", "body": "Georgia Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene have been publicly attacking each other amid an escalating feud between the former political allies.Wood and Greene are controversial figures and staunch supporters of former President Donald Trump. Both appear to have expressed belief in the QAnon conspiracy theory, and both have spread baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being fraudulent.Yet, they have fallen out in recent months, and have been engaged in a war of words on social media.The feud appears to have begun months ago, when Marjorie Taylor Greene replaced Wood as her attorney in a defamation case.\"I am fine with her decision as I guess I was too controversial for Marjorie since I was fighting for Trump to FIX 2020 and she was NOT,\" Wood wrote on his Telegram account.After this, Wood ramped up criticisms of Greene, frequently accusing the congresswoman of not doing enough to try and overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, and calling her a \"communist\" or \"communist sympathizer.\"On September 4, Lin Wood wrote on Telegram that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was a \"communist.\" Lin Wood/TelegramHe added that Greene's calls to impeach President Joe Biden meant that she had accepted his victory.Lin Wood told Insider that he and Greene were no longer \"aligned\" in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\"I have been publicly calling for my former client, Rep. Greene, to take action to pressure Georgia officials to investigate and fix the 2020 Georgia election because of the massive evidence of election fraud and illegality which is publicly available,\" Wood said.In response to his Telegram messages, on Saturday the Georgia congresswoman took to Twitter and Telegram to question Wood's motives and asserting that he is not \"one of us.\"Story continuesGreene pointed out that Wood was fired by his former client Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenage Trump-supporting shooter accused of killing two people during a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.Wood previously raised $2 million for Rittenhouse's bail and then tried to take the money back after being fired.-Marjorie Taylor Greene \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@mtgreenee) October 9, 2021\"Only monsters hurt innocent people in their greatest time of need,\" Greene said about the incident.She then encouraged her followers to donate to a fundraiser for Rittenhouse.Greene added that the fact that Wood has not been targeted by the \"J6 witch hunt,\" referring to the January 6 Commission established to investigate the Capitol insurrection, was evidence that he was not one of Trump's \"biggest defenders.\"In another message posted to Telegram, Greene questioned Wood's character and suggested his invocation of Christianity is disingenuous.\"We don't serve the same God because it's clear you're serving the father of lies,\" Greene wrote.On October 9, Marjorie Taylor Greene posted messages about Lin Wood on her Telegram account. Marjorie Taylor Greene/TelegramWood then took to his Telegram account to respond to Greene, arguing that he had not asked for Rittenhouse's bail to be returned to him personally, but rather to the #FightBack Foundation which raised the money.He added that he hopes he and Greene can \"work out the differences which were publicly aired today.\"\"Why was this controversy aired publicly? Only God knows. He planned it,\" Wood wrote.\"I do not know why Rep. Greene called me a liar. I am not a liar,\" Wood told Insider.\"I have no idea why she called me a monster. Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene repeatedly had her Zoom call muted at the sentencing of Lt Col. Stuart Scheller. He was pleading guilty for defying a gag order by publicly criticizing the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.Scheller has pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges, including displaying contempt toward officials, disrespecting superior commissioned officers, and displaying conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.Congresswoman Greene appeared at the hearing to pledge her support for the Marine whose social media posts critical of the current and former US government went viral. Col. Glen Hines, the military judge, ruling on Scheller's case, repeatedly cut her off.Hines said Greene taking the opportunity to call for Biden's impeachment was irrelevant, and therefore cut her stream, according to the Marine Times.She also added that the troops responsible for an Afghanistan drone strike that killed ten civilians should be convicted of war crimes, The Independent report.Greene stated that she believes General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation's top military officer, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin should be in court rather than Scheller for their actions within the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"I cannot express how millions of Americans are outraged about the military leadership. I believe it was right of him,\" Greene told the hearing, according to The Daily Mail.\"I'm outraged that none of the leaders are sitting in court right now being held accountable for their actions. We need accountability. Thirteen military members died needlessly. We abandoned US citizens in Afghanistan.

Neither of the three politicians personally knew Scheller.In his testimony, Norman compared Scheller to Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL acquitted of murder for allegedly stabbing a wounded ISIS prisoner and taking pictures with the corpse.Gohmert slammed Milley, saying that he disrespected President Trump during the Lafayette Square controversy in Washington in June 2020.All three Republicans testified about the outpouring of support that Scheller had received from the public, saying that was their motivation to testify for him, the Marine Times report.Read the original article on Business Insider", "preprocessed": "rep marjori taylor green r ga speak news confer nation defens author bill u capitol septemb washington dc kevin dietsch getti imagesgeorgia rep marjori taylor green gave charact testimoni lt col start scheller scheller plead guilti defi gag order critic u militari green use opportun call biden impeach mute irrelev georgia rep marjori taylor green repeatedli zoom call mute sentenc lt col stuart scheller plead guilti defi gag order publicli critic u withdraw afghanistan scheller plead guilti six misdemeanor charg includ display contempt toward offici disrespect superior commiss offic display conduct unbecom offic gentleman congresswoman green appear hear pledg support marin whose social medium post critic current former u govern went viral col glen hine militari judg rule scheller case repeatedli cut hine said green take opportun call biden impeach irrelev therefor cut stream accord marin time also ad troop respons afghanistan drone strike kill ten civilian convict war crime independ report green state believ gener mark milley chairman joint chief staff nation top militari offic defens secretari lloyd austin court rather scheller action within withdraw afghanistan express million american outrag militari leadership believ right green told hear accord daili mail outrag none leader sit court right held account action need account thirteen militari member die needlessli abandon u citizen afghanistan ye need account right stand say continu stori continuesgreen appear charact wit stand scheller defens despit know marin person repres louie gohmert texa ralph norman south carolina also appear hear neither three politician person knew scheller testimoni norman compar scheller eddi gallagh navi seal acquit murder allegedli stab wound isi prison take pictur corp gohmert slam milley say disrespect presid trump lafayett squar controversi washington june three republican testifi outpour support scheller receiv public say motiv testifi marin time report read origin articl busi insid"}, {"title": "NFL: Cam Newton reportedly received COVID-19 vaccine", "author": "Chris Cwik", "date": "October 16, 2021, 12:22 PM", "body": "Former New England Patriots quarterback Cam Newton wants back into the NFL. After months of wavering, Newton reportedly received the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Mike Garafolo of NFL Network.That could clear a significant hurdle for Newton, who missed time in the preseason after a \"misunderstanding\" over COVID-19 protocols. That absence may have cost Newton his job.Newton was surprisingly released by the Patriots shortly after that miscommunication. The team handed the starting job to rookie Mac Jones, who has led the Patriots to a 2-3 record. Head coach Bill Belichick said Newton's vaccination status did not play a role in the team's decision to release him.Newton's vaccination status may not have mattered with the Patriots, but it may affect whether other NFL teams are willing to bring him in. The NFL put COVID-19 protocols in place that strongly encourage players to get vaccinated. Unvaccinated players can't be around teammates as much, have to jump through more testing hoops and can be fined a significant amount for breaking those rules.\u00a0With those restrictions no longer an issue, Newton might get more calls from NFL teams.Will Cam Newton return to the NFL?Newton is a three-time Pro Bowler who has made an All-Pro team and won an MVP award during his career. He's put up some eye-popping numbers over his 10 seasons in the NFL, and that should attract teams looking for quarterback help.Now that he's vaccinated, teams will focus on whether Newton can still approach his former numbers. He wasn't a great passer for the Patriots last season, when he threw just eight touchdowns against 10 interceptions in 15 games. Newton was still an effective runner, scoring 12 rushing touchdowns for the Patriots.Newton's diminished passing numbers could be the result of a devastating shoulder injury Newton sustained in 2016. Newton claimed he was fully recovered from that injury prior to last season, however.If Newton's shoulder has recovered, it's possible he can still carve out a solid second act with another NFL team. If not, Newton has plenty of knowledge and could stick around the league as a backup if he's willing to mentor younger players.Cam Newton wants to get back into the NFL.

But he said his campaign did not accept the funds because of doubts about the true source and concerns the contribution was illegal.Prosecutors called Laxalt to testify in Parnas' Manhattan federal court trial. The Ukraine native has been charged with illegally funneling money from a Russian businessman to the campaigns of candidates for office in states where Parnas, Fruman and associates were seeking licenses to run cannabis businesses.Laxalt said he met Giuliani, who was then personal attorney for former President Donald Trump, at the Trump International Hotel in Washington two months before the 2018 state election. Laxalt, a Republican, said he then accompanied Giuliani to a balcony at the hotel, where a group including Parnas were smoking cigars and drinking.Parnas \"immediately offered to help my campaign,\" Laxalt told the jury in the case overseen by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken.There was no suggestion that Giuliani did anything illegal by introducing Laxalt to Parnas. Prosecutors are separately probing whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws while working as Trump's lawyer.

In 2021, an average of 65 million Americans will receive monthly social security benefit checks totaling over $1 trillion paid during the year, according to the Social Security Administration.See: How Does Social Security Get Calculated?Find: 5 Social Security Benefits You Can Claim OnlineWhile the average retiree receives $1,557 per month in benefits, the maximum you can receive per month is $3,895, as GOBankingRates previously reported. However, how much you receive depends on numerous factors.Number of Working YearsHow long have you worked? The Social Security Administration calculates your benefit amount by taking an average of your earned wages over the 35 highest-earning years of your career \u2014 adjusting for inflation over the years.Think means you\u2019ll need to have worked at least 35 years during your life, GOBankingRates reported, and times you weren\u2019t working will result in a lower average and less money.Lifetime EarningsTo be eligible for maximum benefits, you must have consistently had earnings that have equaled or exceeded the SSA\u2019s maximum taxable earnings limit throughout your career. For 2021, the maximum limit is $142,800 per year, although the amount changes yearly to account for cost-of-living adjustments.Even if you don\u2019t consistently earn the maximum limit, noted that you can still boost your benefit amount by increasing your income.When You Plan to File for BenefitsAnother important factor is when you plan to file for benefits. While you can file for social security benefits as early as age 62, waiting longer can earn you more money. If you wait until the age of 70, you are more likely to receive more benefits. You could potentially collect hundreds of dollars more per month if you wait until at least 70.See: 5 Social Security Benefits You Can Claim OnlineFind: Next Year\u2019s Social Security Checks Could Get Biggest COLA Bump in 13 YearsStory continuesHowever, even if you were on track for maximum benefits eligibility, by filing at the age of 62, you would only receive $2,324 per month.

Subscribe for free.Why it matters: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have deep enough pockets to make substantial donations and other aid adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars.Yes, but: Critics of philanthropy say giving can be a way to paper over failures to make real change happen inside boardrooms and workplaces.Between the lines: Many of the companies have also promised to improve conditions internally for Black employees and prospective hires. The high-dollar donations provide one external gauge to track commitments to change.Of note: Donations are gifts, but the portion of these commitments that takes the form of investment can have a financial upside for the companies.GoogleWhat it promised: Shortly after Floyd was killed, Google.org pledged $12 million in donations to racial justice groups, which grew to $320 million in commitments from Google and YouTube in the last year.How it works: These pledges took the form of direct donations, ad grants and technical support. Google also invested $60 million in Black-led startups and venture capital firms, with plans to invest another $40 million by the end of the year.What they did: The Center for Policing Equity was one of the first groups Google said would receive a $1 million donation.Through a partnership with Google.org, Google\u2019s philanthropy arm, CPE launched Justice Navigator in September, which provides data on use of force incidents and vehicle and pedestrian stops, with recommendations on how to use the assessments to advocate for change.MicrosoftWhat it promised: Microsoft says it has committed $246 million toward racial justice efforts since Floyd\u2019s murder, including $76 million in grants and $170 million in loans, investments or deposits.Story continuesSeparately, the company also said last year it plans to double the number of Black-owned suppliers in its network in three years and spend an incremental $500 million with the new and existing suppliers.How it works: Microsoft said it would enhance the weighting of diversity characteristics during the supplier evaluation and selection process, as well as push its top 100 suppliers to make progress on Black representation in their own workforces.What they did: In an update earlier this year, Microsoft said it had \u201crealized growth\u201d in its Black-owned supplier base and implemented a confidential, voluntary workforce representation survey.The company declined to disclose specific spends or supplier amounts so far.AppleWhat it promised: Apple announced a long-term $100 million commitment through a new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative and expanded it to include an additional $30 million this year to help communities of color, with a focus on education, economic equality and criminal justice reform.How it works: So far, REJI has provided funding to historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions, created an app developer academy in Detroit, and invested $50 million in venture capital firms focused on minority-owned businesses.What they did: The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit opened to its first 100 students this month, offering a free, 10-month program to teach coding, design and entrepreneurship \u2014 within the Apple ecosystem. Apple expects to expand the program to 1,000 students.Our thought bubble: That's a lot of potential new developers for Apple\u2019s App Store.AmazonWhat it promised: Amazon said it would donate $27 million (including employee contributions and company matches) to 12 groups \u201cfocused on combating systemic racism,\u201d like the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the National Urban League.The company \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest employers \u2014 also said it set goals to double the number of top Black executives in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder.How it works: The National Urban League said it received over $1 million from Amazon. A spokesperson from the group said the donations were unrestricted, meaning they can go toward any of its programs and operations. Amazon pledged another unrestricted $750,000 to the organization for 2022.What they did: Amazon met its hiring goal, according to its workforce data. The improvement, though, is off a low base: In 2019, just 1.9% of senior leaders were Black. Now that's 3.8%.FacebookWhat it promised: Facebook said it would give $10 million to more than 30 racial justice groups, including All Star Code and the Shriver Center on Poverty Law. It also pledged to invest $100 million in Black-owned small businesses.It said it would distribute 100,000 scholarships to Black students in its Facebook Blueprint program, which credentials digital advertisers.What they did: Of the $100 million commitment to Black-owned businesses, the company said in an update this year that it has so far distributed $40 million of that in the form of grants and ad credits.Like this article?

That was a setback for the Democratic president, who campaigned on the need for policing changes and had declared it an early priority.Additionally, his agenda on gun violence has largely stalled and his initial pick to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives stepped aside in the face of staunch opposition. More recently, Biden has expressed hope that he can still sign a comprehensive police overhaul bill into law, while exploring more executive actions to help hold police officers accountable for breaking the law.At the ceremony, Biden expressed concerns for all officers in the line of duty and mentioned the three constable deputies shot in an ambush early Saturday while working at a Houston bar.

(AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden says he would prefer to cut the duration of programs in his big social services and climate change package rather than eliminate some entirely, as Democrats struggle to win support from moderates by trimming what had been a $3.5 trillion proposal.Biden's comments on Friday, reassuring progressives on what he hopes will be a landmark piece of his legacy, marked his clearest indication yet on how he hopes negotiations over the bill will play out. Appearing to side with a strategy preferred by progressive lawmakers, it marked at least a subtle break with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has suggested that most Democrats prefer to focus on establishing a few enduring programs.He also said there is no deadline for a deal.\u201cI\u2019m of the view that it\u2019s important to establish the principle on a whole range of issues without guaranteeing to get the whole 10 years,\u201d Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington from a trip to Connecticut. \"It matters to establish it.\u201d\u201cSo what happens is, you pass the principle and you build on it,\u201d he added. \u201cYou look back and either it works or it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dPelosi, however, in a Monday note to fellow Democratic lawmakers, said, \u201cOverwhelmingly, the guidance I am receiving from members is to do fewer things well.\u201dBiden said Friday that although he expects the package to shrink, \u201cwe're going to come back and get the rest\u201d after it's passed.\u201cWe're not going to get $3.5 trillion. We'll get less than that, but we're gonna get it. And we're going to come back and get the rest,\u201d Biden said during remarks at a child care center in Connecticut.Democrats on Capitol Hill are working to reduce the sweeping package to about $2 trillion in spending, which would be paid for with higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The proposal includes everything from free child care and community college to dental, vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors and a number of significant provisions meant to combat climate change. They're all key items for progressives, but moderates have balked at the original $3.5 trillion price tag.\u00a0Story continuesOne almost certain reduction would be in the proposal for free community college.\u00a0\u201cI doubt whether we will get the entire funding for community colleges but I\u2019m not going to give up on community colleges as long as I\u2019m president,\u201d Biden said. His wife, Jill, is a professor of English at Northern Virginia Community College.With slim margins in the House and the Senate, Democrats have no votes to spare on the bill. The whittling process has sparked concern from some progressives.\u00a0The party's internal debate was apparent as Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wrote an opinion column for a West Virginia newspaper calling out that state\u2019s Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin by name for blocking the domestic package so far.\u00a0Sanders named Manchin as one of only two Democratic senators who \u201cremain in opposition\u201d to the measure, thwarting the unanimous support the party needs in the 50-50 Senate to approve the still-evolving legislation.\u00a0\u201cThis is a pivotal moment in modern American history. We now have a historic opportunity to support the working families of West Virginia, Vermont and the entire country and create policy which works for all, not just the few,\u201d Sanders wrote in a piece scheduled to appear in Sunday\u2019s Charleston Gazette-Mail.Manchin shot back in a statement late Friday, saying: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time an out-of-stater has tried to tell West Virginians what is best for them.\"It\u2019s highly unusual for a senator to publicly criticize a colleague of the same party, particularly by wading into the other lawmaker\u2019s state.\u00a0Manchin has proposed holding the measure\u2019s overall 10-year cost to $1.5 trillion and has said he wants to limit some health care initiatives to benefit only lower-earning people.\u00a0Sanders and Manchin stand, respectively, as among the Democrats\u2019 most progressive and conservative senators.Biden has openly acknowledged the price tag of his package will have to come down. On Friday, he visited a child development center in Hartford to speak about a need for investments in child care and other social safety net programs, arguing they're imperative to keep America competitive in the global economy.At the center, Biden promoted his proposal to make such care free for lower-income families, and ensure that families making up to 150% of their state's median income pay less than 7% of their salaries on child care. It's part of a massive expansion of the social safety net that Biden has championed and is aiming to pass with just Democratic votes in Congress.\u201cToo many folks in Washington still don\u2019t realize it isn\u2019t enough just to invest in our physical infrastructure.

There is renewed urgency among Democrats to push it through ahead of an end-of-month deadline on transportation funding, Biden's upcoming foreign trip, and a closer-than-anticipated race for Virginia's next governor.The fate of the legislation, branded \u201cBuild Back Better\" by Biden, is also holding up a more than $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed the Senate this summer. House progressives are balking at supporting that roads-and-bridges bill until agreement is reached on a path forward for the social safety net package.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an interview this week with The Associated Press, Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate for Virginia governor, criticized Democrats including Biden over the lack of progress.\u201cThey all got to get their act together and vote,\u201d McAuliffe said.

Now they are increasingly being asked to weigh in on the deworming drug ivermectin.At least two dozen lawsuits have been filed around the U.S., many in recent weeks, by people seeking to force hospitals to give their COVID-stricken loved ones ivermectin, a drug for parasites that has been promoted by conservative commentators as a treatment despite a lack of conclusive evidence that it helps people with the virus.Interest in the drug started rising toward the end of last year and the beginning of this one, when studies \u2014 some later withdrawn, in other countries \u2014 seemed to suggest ivermectin had some potential and it became a hot topic of conversation among conservatives on social media.The lawsuits, several of them filed by the same western New York lawyer, cover similar ground. The families have gotten prescriptions for ivermectin, but hospitals have refused to use it on their loved ones, who are often on ventilators and facing death.There has been a mix of results in state courts. Some judges have refused to order hospitals to give ivermectin. Others have ordered medical providers to give the medication, despite concerns it could be harmful.In a September case on Staten Island, state Supreme Court Judge Ralph Porzio refused to order the use of ivermectin in a situation where a man sued a hospital on behalf of his ill father, citing its unproven impact.\u201cThis court will not require any doctor to be placed in a potentially unethical position wherein they could be committing medical malpractice by administering a medication for an unapproved, alleged off-label purpose,\" he wrote.It's astonishing, said James Beck, an attorney in Philadelphia who specializes in drug and medical device product liability and has written about the influx of cases. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before.\u201dStory continuesIn some cases, an initial order to give the drug has been reversed later.Hospitals have pushed back, saying their standards of care don't allow them to give patients a drug that hasn't been approved for COVID and could potentially cause harm, and that allowing laypeople and judges to overrule medical professionals is a dangerous road to go down.\u201cThe way medicine works is, they are the experts, the doctors and ... the hospitals,\" said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. \u201cWhen you go there, you\u2019re not going to a restaurant. You don't order your own treatments.\"\u201cYou can\u2019t have a medical field that\u2019s subjected to having to practice according to patient demand backed up by court orders. That is positively horrible medicine\" Caplan said.Ralph Lorigo doesn't see it that way. The attorney from Buffalo, New York, filed his first of several ivermectin lawsuits in January after being approached by the family of an 80-year-old woman who was in the hospital on a ventilator. His second case was later that month, for a hospitalized 65-year-old woman.In both cases, judges ordered hospitals to give the women get ivermectin as their families wanted. Both women survived their hospitalizations.Lorigo, who has taken on numerous cases since, is adamant that ivermectin works. Health experts and federal agencies say that any evidence of it being effective against COVID-19 is slim and more research needs to be done. Studies are currently underway.Ivermectin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat infections of roundworms, lice and other tiny parasites in humans. The FDA has tried to debunk claims that animal-strength versions of the drug can help fight COVID-19, warning that taking it in large doses can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, delirium and even death.Lorigo said his clients haven't sought those kinds of doses, only the versions of the medication made for humans.Of doctors refusing to treat patients with ivermectin, Lorigo said, \u201cthey are not gods because they wear white jackets,\u201d he said. \u201cI take issue with their stance.\u201dAnd as for hospital administrators, \u201cit\u2019s like only they rule the roost, only they make a decision in their hospital. I\u2019m not accepting that as a rule of law for us.\u201dThe court fights over the drug have taken place as courts have also wrestled with issues like whether employers or states can order workers to be vaccinated against the virus, which has killed more than  700,000 people in the U.S.Beck, the drug liability lawyer, said that doctors do have the power to prescribe ivermectin to treat COVID, even though it hasn't been approved by the FDA for that disease, if they think it has therapeutic value \u2014 a so-called \u201coff label\u201d use.\u201cI have never seen a case before this where the judge was asked to force someone to engage in an off label use,\" he said.Lorigo said he has received more inquiries from families about the drug in the last 10 weeks and now has four attorneys working on these cases, including two he recently hired.", "preprocessed": "new york ap mask rule vaccin mandat busi shutdown land court covid outbreak confront judg question scienc govern author increasingli ask weigh deworm drug ivermectin least two dozen lawsuit file around u mani recent week peopl seek forc hospit give covid stricken love one ivermectin drug parasit promot conserv comment treatment despit lack conclus evid help peopl viru interest drug start rise toward end last year begin one studi later withdrawn countri seem suggest ivermectin potenti becam hot topic convers among conserv social medium lawsuit sever file western new york lawyer cover similar ground famili gotten prescript ivermectin hospit refus use love one often ventil face death mix result state court judg refus order hospit give ivermectin other order medic provid give medic despit concern could harm septemb case staten island state suprem court judg ralph porzio refus order use ivermectin situat man su hospit behalf ill father cite unproven impact court requir doctor place potenti uneth posit wherein could commit medic malpractic administ medic unapprov alleg label purpos wrote astonish said jame beck attorney philadelphia special drug medic devic product liabil written influx case never seen anyth like stori continuesin case initi order give drug revers later hospit push back say standard care allow give patient drug approv covid could potenti caus harm allow laypeopl judg overrul medic profession danger road go way medicin work expert doctor hospit said arthur caplan professor bioethic new york univers grossman school medicin go go restaur order treatment medic field subject practic accord patient demand back court order posit horribl medicin caplan said ralph lorigo see way attorney buffalo new york file first sever ivermectin lawsuit januari approach famili year old woman hospit ventil second case later month hospit year old woman case judg order hospit give woman get ivermectin famili want woman surviv hospit lorigo taken numer case sinc adam ivermectin work health expert feder agenc say evid effect covid slim research need done studi current underway ivermectin approv food drug administr treat infect roundworm louse tini parasit human fda tri debunk claim anim strength version drug help fight covid warn take larg dose caus nausea vomit diarrhea seizur delirium even death lorigo said client sought kind dose version medic made human doctor refus treat patient ivermectin lorigo said god wear white jacket said take issu stanc hospit administr like rule roost make decis hospit accept rule law u court fight drug taken place court also wrestl issu like whether employ state order worker vaccin viru kill peopl u beck drug liabil lawyer said doctor power prescrib ivermectin treat covid even though approv fda diseas think therapeut valu call label use never seen case judg ask forc someon engag label use said lorigo said receiv inquiri famili drug last week four attorney work case includ two recent hire"}, {"title": "More Lead-Tainted Water in Michigan Draws Attention to Aging Pipes", "author": "Mitch Smith", "date": "October 16, 2021, 11:23 AM", "body": "Residents wait for a bottled water giveaway in Benton Harbor, Mich., Oct. 13, 2021. (Sebastian Hidalgo/The New York Times)BENTON HARBOR, Mich. \u2014 During the three years that officials have known about dangerous amounts of lead flowing from faucets in Benton Harbor, they have sent out notices, distributed filters and tried to improve water treatment. But the problems persisted, and some residents said they never heard about the risks of the toxic water coming from their taps.Now, in scenes reminiscent of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan officials have told Benton Harbor residents not to drink, cook or brush their teeth with tap water. Elected officials came to town Thursday promising help. And so many cars have turned out for bottled water giveaways that traffic has been snarled, a rarity in a place with 9,100 residents.\u201cIt\u2019s horrible to watch, to see my city like this,\u201d Rosetta Valentine, 63, said as she directed traffic at a water distribution site where some people lined up nearly an hour before the event started.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York TimesResidents of Benton Harbor see parallels between their plight and the water crisis that unfolded less than three hours up the highway in Flint, also a majority-Black city, where a change in the water source in 2014 led to residents drinking contaminated water despite repeated assurances that it was safe. In Benton Harbor, where thousands of homes are connected to the water system by lead pipes, efforts to bring down problematic lead readings by using corrosion controls have so far failed, and officials have recently grown concerned that lead-removing filters given to residents since 2019 might not work.The problems in Benton Harbor and Flint are extreme examples of a broader, national failure of water infrastructure that experts say requires massive and immediate investment to solve. Across the country, in cities like Chicago, Pittsburgh and Clarksburg, West Virginia, Americans are drinking dangerous quantities of brain-damaging lead as agencies struggle to modernize water treatment plants and launch efforts to replace the lead service lines that connect buildings to the water system. Health officials say there is no safe level of lead exposure.Story continues\u201cWe\u2019ve basically just been living off our great-grandparents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 investments in our water infrastructure and not been dealing with these festering problems,\u201d said Erik D. Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group that pressed for faster action to address the contamination in Benton Harbor. He added that the lead problem was just part of \u201cthis ticking time bomb we have underground of lead pipes, of water mains that are bursting.\u201dPresident Joe Biden has made replacing lead pipes a priority, and the infrastructure bill currently languishing in Congress would set aside billions of dollars to address that and other problems with the country\u2019s water systems. The bill, which has some Republican support, includes about $55 billion to improve water systems, although other Republicans have expressed concerns about costs.But amid uncertainty about whether that bill and an expansive domestic policy package will pass, and about how much money would eventually make it to small communities like this one, the prospect of congressional help feels remote to many in Benton Harbor.\u201cIt\u2019s too distant and they\u2019re going to do what they do anyway \u2014 I can\u2019t sit here and sweat that,\u201d said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, a pastor in Benton Harbor who was delivering bottled water to residents\u2019 doorsteps, and who said he holds Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, responsible for fixing the problem.Many U.S. cities face severe water problems. In Newark, New Jersey, where lead problems were allowed to fester, a yearslong effort to replace lead pipes is nearly complete. But lead is only one of the growing issues in local water systems. In Wichita, Kansas, hundreds of thousands of people were placed under a boil water advisory this month after a decades-old pipe burst. In Jackson, Mississippi, a winter storm this year froze pipes and placed much of the city under a boil advisory for weeks. And in parts of the American West, lengthy droughts have exacerbated water shortages, forcing painful decisions about how much farmers and other customers can use.The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the country\u2019s water infrastructure a C-minus grade this year, describing the national system as \u201caging and underfunded\u201d despite recent efforts to invest in improvements. Emily Feenstra, the group\u2019s managing director for government relations and infrastructure initiatives, said the legislation in Congress offered an opportunity to make up for lost time in fixing those crumbling systems, especially in small cities that may lack the resources or expertise to make changes on their own.\u201cIt is an urgent problem: It\u2019s something that we have a huge opportunity to address right now with this infrastructure bill,\u201d Feenstra said. \u201cAs we kick the can down the road by just kind of doing the bare minimum, the costs rise exponentially.\u201dIn Benton Harbor, state officials said Thursday that they would continue distributing free bottled water, and Whitmer, who is up for reelection next year, set an 18-month goal for replacing the lead pipes connecting homes to the water system. That process will cost almost $30 million and had once been expected to take years. But the water problems in Benton Harbor are not new, and questions have mounted about why city, state and federal officials did not take more aggressive action sooner.\u201cIf I had a magic wand, I would solve every problem that\u2019s plaguing the city of Benton Harbor as we speak,\u201d Mayor Marcus Muhammad said. \u201cHowever, government doesn\u2019t work that way. The city of Benton Harbor is a creature of the state, and the state is a creature of the federal government.\u201dAsked whether the steps taken Thursday should have occurred when officials learned of the city\u2019s high lead levels three years ago, Elizabeth Hertel, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said she couldn\u2019t say.\u201cTo be honest, these should have been replaced years ago, and we shouldn\u2019t even be in the position that we\u2019re in, but we are,\u201d said Hertel, who said the proposed federal infrastructure funds would help address faltering systems across Michigan.Michigan\u2019s lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist II, said Thursday during a visit to Benton Harbor that the state had been working with the city since 2018 on water issues but that \u201cthose efforts had not yet fully addressed the challenge.\u201d He said the decisions to provide bottled water and speed up lead line replacement were \u201can appropriate escalation of that response.\u201dBenton Harbor, which sits across Lake Michigan from Chicago, has a proud manufacturing history, a championship golf course and a downtown showing signs of revival. But the city has endured decades of disinvestment and hardship.Some residents said they saw what happened several years ago in Flint and began worrying about the water quality. Some people in Benton Harbor stopped drinking the tap water long ago. Some had complaints about the taste. Others grew worried in recent years as test after test came back showing Benton Harbor well above the federal action level for lead of 15 parts per billion in 10% of samples.But other residents, like Michael Johnson, who watched from his porch as cars lined up for a water giveaway, are only now finding out about the risks their tap water poses. The problems have lingered for years, but the response has ramped up dramatically in recent weeks. Last month, local and national environmental groups petitioned the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which last year gave the city a grant to start replacing lead pipes, to intervene more aggressively in Benton Harbor. Whitmer pledged millions in state money to fix lead lines. Then came the warnings not to drink the tap water.\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of scared,\u201d Johnson, 50, said. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking a lot of juice since the day before yesterday, too, trying to stay away from the tap.\u201dAbout 45% of residents in Benton Harbor live in poverty, and the school system is faltering. Like Flint, Benton Harbor spent time under state-appointed emergency management. And just two years ago, Whitmer tried to close Benton Harbor High School before backing down amid protests.For many in the city, the water is just one more indignity. And some cannot help but wonder if the situation would be different if Benton Harbor\u2019s population were wealthier or whiter. Across the bridge in St. Joseph, a majority-white city, there is no such water emergency.\u201cSome people are still alive where the Blacks had their water fountain and the whites had theirs,\u201d said Duane L. Seats II, Benton Harbor\u2019s mayor pro-tem and the pastor of a church hosting bottled water giveaways. \u201cSo what\u2019s the difference in this situation now?\u201dIt has all been frightening, said Erica Moss, 26, a mother of four, who started buying up bottled water recently after hearing about the elevated lead levels on Facebook. Lead is known to damage the brain and nervous system, impair growth and contribute to behavioral problems, with especially severe effects in children.\u201cIt\u2019s always a problem here going on \u2014 it\u2019s always something going on in Benton Harbor,\u201d said Moss, who expressed doubt that a fix would materialize any time soon. \u201cI was shocked, but not shocked at the same time.\u201d\u00a9 2021 The New York Times Company", "preprocessed": "resid wait bottl water giveaway benton harbor mich oct sebastian hidalgo new york time benton harbor mich three year offici known

There was no crime \u2014 but they took it.", "author": "Rich Schapiro and Alexandra Chaidez", "date": "October 16, 2021, 5:01 AM", "body": "A pair of New Mexico businessmen were driving along Interstate 40 in Oklahoma late one night in April when a sheriff\u2019s deputy flipped on his lights and sirens and pulled over their BMW sedan.The two men, Nang Thai and Weichuan Liu, were on their way to a hotel in Oklahoma City. They planned to catch some sleep before heading out in the morning to close on a 10-acre plot of farmland they\u2019d agreed to buy for $100,000.But now, at about 2 a.m. on April 19, a Canadian County sheriff\u2019s deputy was peering into their car.\u201cWe didn\u2019t understand why he pulled us over,\u201d said Thai, 51, a Vietnamese immigrant and father of two from Albuquerque. \u201cI was driving under the speed limit.\u201dThey had no way of knowing at the time but Thai and Liu were about to begin an hourslong ordeal that would leave them stripped of all their cash and searching for answers. Their experience highlights the controversial law enforcement practice known as civil asset forfeiture, in which police can confiscate a person\u2019s cash or other property even without bringing criminal charges.The deputy asked the two men for their licenses, where they were going and whether they were carrying any money, according to Thai.They had a large amount of cash in the vehicle: more than $100,000, which Thai says they brought to pay for the property. Thai \u2014 who speaks English with a heavy accent (Liu speaks very little English at all) \u2014 told the officer they were headed to a hotel and, yes, had cash on them.Video: Man becomes civil rights lawyer after wrongful convictionThe deputy said he suspected they were involved in \u201cillegal activity,\u201d according to Thai. A criminal background search would have turned up a 2017 conviction against Liu for growing marijuana in California.After a second officer arrived at the scene, the men were driven to a police station and interrogated for hours. Deputies emptied a backpack and suitcase full of cash, then pulled apart the inside of the BMW but apparently turned up no guns, drugs or any other illicit items.Story continuesThai said he told his interrogators they had saved up the money for years and were planning to use the land for farming but hadn\u2019t yet determined which crops to raise.\u201cThey kept saying, \u2018This is illegal money,\u2019\u201d Thai said. \u201cI said, \u2018Okay, prove it. We didn't do anything illegal.\u2019\u201dThe two men were released without being charged or even issued a traffic ticket, but the Canadian County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not return their cash. Court papers filed by District Attorney Michael Fields say the money was seized because it was intended to be used to violate drug laws or resulted from illegal drug transactions.The men are now fighting to get it back. Adding insult to injury, they contend that the amount the sheriff\u2019s office says it confiscated \u2013 $131,500 \u2013 is actually $10,000 short of the total they had in their car that day.\u201cNow I have to prove I\u2019m innocent, and they are the ones who illegally took my money and basically stole some of my money, too,\u201d said Thai.New Mexico businessman Nang Thai. (Minesh Bacrania for NBC News)The court docket contains no records detailing the traffic stop or the seizure, and neither the sheriff's office nor the district attorney\u2019s office agreed to comment.Among those surprised by the turn of events is the man who was set to sell his land to Thai and Liu.\u201cI was shocked when I heard of the confiscation of their money,\u201d the seller told NBC News.He said he had met with them a few days earlier and had drawn up a contract to sell the property to Thai for $100,000. NBC News has viewed a copy of the agreement.\u201cThey seemed like very nice and intelligent business people,\u201d said the seller, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI feel bad for them and the situation.\u201dWhat happened to Thai and Liu is not at all unusual.Federal and local law enforcement have broad authority in many parts of the country to seize a person\u2019s property if it is suspected to be linked to criminal activity. Civil asset forfeiture allows the authorities to confiscate items like cash and cars even without charging the people forced to give up their property.Defenders of the practice say it\u2019s a vital tool in fighting drug traffickers, who are known to hide ill-gotten cash in vehicles and other items. But critics across the political spectrum argue that it violates constitutional rights and disproportionately impacts minorities and low-income people who are more likely to be profiled by police and less likely to have the resources to challenge the seizures.\u201cBillions of dollars are taken yearly from citizens who are never charged with a crime, and are not afforded any of the due process provisions of the Constitution, such as a day in court, presumption of innocence, right to counsel, and an impartial jury,\u201d said Brad Cates, former director of the Justice Department\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Office during the Reagan Administration who has become an outspoken critic of civil forfeiture.So far this year, local law enforcement agencies confiscated more than $1.3 million from people driving through Canadian County, according to an NBC News review of court records.At least 58 percent of the 31 cash seizures involved minorities only \u2013 with Asian people making up 23 percent, Black 19 percent and Hispanic 16 percent. White people accounted for 26 percent of the forfeitures in Canadian County, which is more than 75 percent white.Only 14 out of the 31 cash forfeitures resulted in criminal charges, or 45 percent, court records show.In 2020, some 43 percent of the 53 cash seizures in Canadian County involved minorities. Black people accounted for 18 percent, Hispanic 17 percent, Asian 7 percent and white 26 percent, according to the NBC News review. The cash seizures yielded more than $1.8 million dollars, court records show, and 31 of the 53 resulted in criminal charges, or 58 percent.The high percentage of minorities subjected to cash seizures in Canadian County is not a new trend.The nonprofit investigative news site Oklahoma Watch found that 60 percent of the cash seizures in Canadian County between 2010 and 2015 involved minorities. Nine other counties in Oklahoma, including the six largest, had roughly the same percentage over that five-year time period, according to Oklahoma Watch.Megan Lambert, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said she found the figures on cash forfeitures and race \u201cin no way surprising.\u201d\u201cRacism and implicit bias have a greater impact where discretion is allowed, and police enjoy a significant amount of discretion over civil asset forfeitures,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lack of accountability or transparency and the perverse financial incentives of civil asset forfeiture make the process ripe for abuse and bias.\u201d\u201cHighway robbers\u201dMore than 30 states have instituted reforms in recent years to protect people from civil asset forfeiture, such as shifting the burden of proof to the authorities. Others \u2014 like New Mexico, North Carolina, Nebraska and Maine \u2014 have abolished it all together.But Oklahoma is not among the states to take significant action to curtail the practice.It has among the worst civil forfeiture laws in the country, according to the Institute for Justice, a Virginia-based public interest law firm that releases reports grading state forfeiture laws. Oklahoma earned a D-minus grade in the latest Institute for Justice report, which cited the low bar for confiscating cash and the large incentive created by the seized money going directly to the law enforcement agencies themselves.\u201cThe government just has to show by a preponderance of evidence, or more likely than not, the property is connected to illegal activity,\u201d said Dan Alban, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice. \u201cThat\u2019s a very low burden of proof. It effectively places the burden on the property owner to prove their own innocence.\u201dCanadian County straddles Interstate 40, a major drug trafficking corridor that runs from California to the North Carolina coast. The county sheriff\u2019s office and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol devote substantial resources to combating it. But civil liberties lawyers and local defense attorneys argue that law enforcement uses the focus on drug interdiction as cover for stopping and searching vehicles on flimsy pretenses.William Campbell, an Oklahoma City-based defense attorney with expertise challenging civil forfeitures, said in any other context the officers, who are known to target cars with out of state license plates, would be seen as \u201ccommon highway robbers.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re innocent or anything else,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cThey\u2019re going to do whatever they\u2019re going to do \u2014 generally in the dark, on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere \u2014 where you as the citizen are completely at their mercy.\u201d\u201cDistrict attorneys fund their offices with this money,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen the DA is making half a million or more off of these stops, how can they be an honest broker on whether these stops are good? They have no incentive to stop this.\u201dCanadian County Sheriff Chris West declined to comment on the use of civil forfeiture or the case of Liu and Thai. A well-known figure in Oklahoma, West faced controversy earlier this year when it emerged that he attended the Jan. 6 rally in Washington protesting former President Trump\u2019s election loss. He said he walked to the Capitol but did not enter the building or participate in mob violence.Calls to District Attorney Michael Fields\u2019 office were referred to the prosecutor handling the case, Mitchell Thrower, who did not respond to a request for comment. At a 2015 hearing for a doomed bill to reform civil forfeiture laws in Oklahoma, Fields voiced his opposition to legislation that would, among other things, prohibit forfeiture without a conviction. \u200b\u200b\u201cAsset forfeiture is the only tool at our disposal that allows us to take drugs off the streets and profits out of the hands of those who only seek more drugs, more money and more lives to destroy,\u201d Fields said.Four decades of savingsThai said he was 16 when he arrived in the U.S. on a boat from Vietnam in 1986. After graduating high school in Albuquerque, he attended community college and then worked at Intel for 16 years as a technical engineer and data analyst. He went on to open and run a restaurant, the Asian Grill, until 2019.Thai says he saved a chunk of money over the years and largely eschewed banks. \u201cIn my culture, we use cash,\u201d he said.Seeking a safe investment, he said he began studying vertical farming, which involves growing crops in vertical stacks using hydroponics, and looking around for a cheap piece of land to purchase. He found a partner in Liu, who he met through the Albuquerque restaurant scene.\u201cYou never lose money if you buy a piece of farm land,\u201d Thai said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Bill Gates bought so much land.\u201dThai said he told the officers who grilled him that they had worked hard for their money and had no firm plans on what they were going to do with the land.\u201cHe kept asking where did the money come from? Where did I work?\u201d Thai said. \u201cI said, \u2018I lived here a long time. I worked many years.\u2019\u201dAfter the interrogations were over and the deputies let the men go, they received no paperwork related to the forfeiture, Thai said. Campbell, the local defense lawyer not involved in the case, said law enforcement is supposed to issue property receipts detailing what was seized but doesn't always do so.The Canadian County District Attorney filed a notice of forfeiture on April 22, which gave Thai and Liu 45 days to file a claim to the cash. Their attorney responded on May 10, denying that the money was connected to drug activity and asserting that the forfeiture violated their Fourth Amendment rights.The lawyer for Thai and Liu, Richard Anderson, did not respond to requests for comment.Through a translator, Liu declined to comment.He was arrested in June 2017 after police found more than 600 marijuana plants at a house he was staying in with two others in Stockton, Calif. Liu, now 45, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of cultivating marijuana and served 30 days in the county jail, said a spokeswoman for the San Joaquin County District Attorney\u2019s Office.In the days after the Oklahoma traffic stop, a Canadian County prosecutor suggested to a local newspaper that the cash seizure was based on their intention to grow marijuana.Oklahoma legalized medical marijuana in 2018. Under state law, at least 75 percent of a medical marijuana business must be owned by an Oklahoma resident for it to be licensed.\u201cAn out-of-state person, for example, can\u2019t come to Oklahoma and start their own marijuana farm,\u201d Canadian County Assistant District Attorney Eric Epplin told the Yukon Progress, speaking generally about the case. \u201cYou have to be a resident of the state.\u201dThe regulation allows for someone to move to the state and apply for a license after two years.Thai said he was aware of the licensing requirements but insisted that they weren\u2019t set on growing cannabis.\u201cThat\u2019s their narrative that they\u2019re using against us,\u201d he said of the police and prosecutors.\u201cWe saw it as a good investment,\u201d he added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know yet what we were going to do. It could be anything \u2014 it could be marijuana, it could be something else.\u201dJames Todd, an Oklahoma City defense lawyer who is not involved in the case, said he thinks prosecutors may have a tough time proving the men intended to use the land to start an illegal drug operation.\u201cI don\u2019t see in this case anything other than a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 situation, where the state says they intended to grow marijuana without a license and the men say no they weren\u2019t,\u201d said Todd, who worked as a detective and state prosecutor in Oklahoma before becoming a defense attorney.A pre-trial court hearing has been set for Oct. 20. Thai, meanwhile, has set his sights on a new venture closer to home: a bubble tea shop in Albuquerque.\"I\u2019ve been living here since 1986 and worked hard for four decades,\u201d Thai said. \u201cI just want my money back.\u201d", "preprocessed": "pair new mexico businessmen drive along interst oklahoma late one night april sheriff deputi flip light siren pull bmw sedan two men nang thai

CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A NASA spacecraft named Lucy rocketed into the sky with diamonds Saturday morning on a 12-year quest to explore eight asteroids.Seven of the mysterious space rocks are among swarms of asteroids sharing Jupiter's orbit, thought to be the pristine leftovers of planetary formation.An Atlas V rocket blasted off before dawn, sending Lucy on a roundabout journey spanning nearly 4 billion miles (6.3 billion kilometers). Researchers grew emotional describing the successful launch \u2014 lead scientist Hal Levison said it was like witnessing the birth of a child. \u201cGo Lucy!\u201d he urged.Lucy is named after the 3.2 million-year-old skeletal remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia nearly a half-century ago. That discovery got its name from the 1967 Beatles song \u201cLucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\u201d prompting NASA to send the spacecraft soaring with band members' lyrics and other luminaries\u2019 words of wisdom imprinted on a plaque. The spacecraft also carried a disc made of lab-grown diamonds for one of its science instruments.In a prerecorded video for NASA, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr paid tribute to his late colleague John Lennon, credited for writing the song that inspired all this.\u201cI'm so excited \u2014 Lucy is going back in the sky with diamonds. Johnny will love that,\u201d Starr said. \u201cAnyway, if you meet anyone up there, Lucy, give them peace and love from me.\u201dThe paleoanthropologist behind the fossil Lucy discovery, Donald Johanson, had goose bumps watching Lucy soar \u2014 \u201cI will never look at Jupiter the same ... absolutely mind-expanding.\u201d He said he was filled with wonder about this \u201cintersection of our past, our present and our future.\u201d\u201cThat a human ancestor who lived so long ago stimulated a mission which promises to add valuable information about the formation of our solar system is incredibly exciting,\u201d said Johanson, of Arizona State University, who traveled to Cape Canaveral for his first rocket launch.Story continuesLucy\u2019s $981 million mission is the first to aim for Jupiter\u2019s so-called Trojan entourage: thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of asteroids that share the gas giant\u2019s expansive orbit around the sun. Some of the Trojan asteroids precede Jupiter in its orbit, while others trail it.Despite their orbits, the Trojans are far from the planet and mostly scattered far from each other. So there\u2019s essentially zero chance of Lucy getting clobbered by one as it swoops past its targets, said Levison of Southwest Research Institute, the mission\u2019s principal scientist.Lucy will swing past Earth next October and again in 2024 to get enough gravitational oomph to make it all the way out to Jupiter\u2019s orbit. On the way there, the spacecraft will zip past asteroid Donaldjohanson between Mars and Jupiter. The aptly named rock will serve as a 2025 warm-up act for the science instruments.Drawing power from two huge circular solar wings, Lucy will chase down five asteroids in the leading pack of Trojans in the late 2020s. The spacecraft will then zoom back toward Earth for another gravity assist in 2030. That will send Lucy back out to the trailing Trojan cluster, where it will zip past the final two targets in 2033 for a record-setting eight asteroids visited in a single mission.It\u2019s a complicated, circuitous path that had NASA\u2019s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen, shaking his head at first. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. This is possible?\u201d he recalled asking.Lucy will pass within 600 miles (965 kilometers) of each target; the biggest one is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) across.\u201cAre there mountains? Valleys? Pits? Mesas? Who knows? I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to be surprised,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Hal Weaver, who\u2019s in charge of Lucy\u2019s black-and-white camera. \u201cBut we can hardly wait to see what ... images will reveal about these fossils from the formation of the solar system.\u201dNASA plans to launch another mission next month to test whether humans might be able to alter an asteroid's orbit \u2014 practice in case Earth ever has a killer rock headed this way.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Auriemma signed a new contract in May.\u00a0Staley among highest paid coaches\u00a0Head coach Dawn Staley of the South Carolina Gamecocks celebrates a berth in the Final Four last spring. (C. Morgan Engel/NCAA Photos via Getty Images)Staley, who enters her 14th season at South Carolina, will make a base salary of $1 million per year with outside compensation starting at $1.9 million in the first year, the school said. The outside compensation will increase by $100,000 each of the seven years so that her total package in 2027-28 is $3.5 million.\u00a0\u201cCredit where it\u2019s due,\u201d Staley said, via USA Today Sports. \u201cThis university and this state have a rich history of racism, and I\u2019m not going to disregard that. But this is one of the most progressive decisions they\u2019ve ever made. They need to be recognized for being committed to leading the way in gender equity in America. This is an equitable statement and in the midst of all our inequities in our country, I hope it\u2019s a turning point.\u201dStory continuesCoaches leading top women's programs are very slowly being rewarded with larger contracts like ones men's coaches have garnered. According to a USA Today Sports database of men's coaching salaries, Staley's new deal would place her around 32nd overall, and Auriemma at 27th.\u00a0There are about 12 coaches in women's basketball who have broken the $1 million per year mark that about 70 men's coaches eclipsed. They are, per USA Today Sports, Adia Barnes (Arizona), Gary Blair (Texas A&M), Brenda Frese (Maryland), Kelly Graves (Oregon), Kim Mulkey (LSU), Vic Schaefer (Texas), Vivian Stringer (Rutgers) and Jeff Walz (Louisville).\u00a0Salaries at private institutions are not required as public information, so Stanford head coach Tara Vanderveer's salary is unknown. According to Stanford University tax filings in 2016, she made about $2.3 million.\u00a0Gamecocks continue to climb under StaleyThe Gamecocks won their second consecutive SEC Tournament title, and sixth under Staley, before falling in the 2021 Final Four. Stanford won that game, 66-65, and went on to defeat Arizona in the national championship game.\u00a0It was the third Final Four berth in six years for Staley, who has taken South Carolina to at least the Sweet 16 every year since 2014 (excluding 2020, when the tournament was canceled). The Gamecocks, behind WNBA MVP Wilson, won their first and so far only national title in 2017. Staley became only the second Black female coach in NCAA basketball to win it.\u00a0\"Dawn Staley is one of the nation's top coaches, regardless of the sport,\" South Carolina Athletics Director Ray Tanner said in a release. \"She has built our women's basketball program from the ground up, and her teams have produced champions, both on and off the floor. The ability to keep Coach Staley at the University of South Carolina is great news for all Gamecocks. I join with our fans in looking forward to seeing the great achievements her program will continue to produce in the future.\"The Gamecocks enter the 2021-22 season with every member of last year's Final Four team as well as ACC Freshman of the Year and Co-Defender of the Year Kamilla Cardoso, who transferred from Syracuse. South Carolina brings in the No. 1 recruiting class, per ESPNW rankings.

She has worked tirelessly to grow the team and the sport as a whole, beginning as soon as she walked onto campus from coaching at Temple. Staley has been gracious and creative with reporters so that South Carolina is rightfully covered well locally and been active in bringing fans to Colonial Life Arena.\u00a0The team had an average attendance of 3,000 when she began and averaged more than 13,000 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salvatore Cubito blesses Samuel De Luca during his baptism ritual at a church in Catania, Italy, Oct. 3, 2021. (Gianni Cipriano/The New York Times)CATANIA, Italy \u2014 The mother had prepared everything for the baptism. She dressed her infant son Antonio in a handmade satin suit with tails and a matching cream-colored top hat glittering with rhinestones. She hired the photographers and bought the baby a gold cross. She booked a big buffet lunch for the whole clan at the Copacabana.But as the parish priest in the Sicilian city of Catania went through the usual liturgy, calling on the family to renounce Satan and ladling holy water on the squirming baby\u2019s head, one major part of the ritual went missing.There was no godfather.Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d said Agata Peri, 68, little Antonio\u2019s great-grandmother. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t make this decision.\u201dThe church did. That weekend in October, the Roman Catholic diocese of Catania enacted a three-year ban on the ancient tradition of naming godparents at baptisms and christenings. Church officials argue that the once-essential figure in a child\u2019s Catholic education has lost all spiritual significance. Instead, they say, it has become a networking opportunity for families looking to improve their fortunes, secure endowments of gold necklaces and make advantageous connections, sometimes with local power brokers who have dozens of godchildren.God parenting, church officials said, had fallen to earth as a secular custom between relatives or neighbors \u2014 many deficient in faith or living in sin, and was now a mere method of strengthening family ties.And sometimes mob ties, too.Italian prosecutors have tracked baptisms to map out how underworld bosses spread influence, and mob widows in court have saved their most poisonous spite for \u201cthe real Judases\u201d who betray the baptismal bond. It is a transgression most associated with, well, \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d especially the baptism scene when Michael Corleone renounces Satan in church as his henchmen whack all of his enemies.But church officials warn that secularization more than anything led them to rub out the godparents, a Sicilian thing that\u2019s been going on for 2,000 years, or at least since the church\u2019s dicey first days, when sponsors known to bishops vouched for converts to prevent pagan infiltration.Story continues\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment,\u201d said Monsignor Salvatore Genchi, the vicar general of Catania, as he held a copy of the ban in his office behind the city\u2019s basilica. A godfather to at least 15 godchildren, the monsignor said he was well qualified for the role, but he estimated that 99% of the diocese\u2019s godparents were not.The break would allow the church some time to send Catania back to Catholic school, but Genchi was not optimistic that it would stick. \u201cIt seems very difficult to me,\u201d he said, \u201cthat one can turn back.\u201dIn 2014, Archbishop Giuseppe Fiorini Morosini of Reggio Calabria, where the \u2019ndrangheta mob is rooted, proposed a 10-year stop on godfathers, arguing in a letter to Pope Francis that a secular society had spiritually gutted the figure. That, he said, also made it ripe for exploitation by mobsters.Morosini said that a top Vatican official, Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu, who is now on trial in the Vatican on money laundering charges, responded that all of Calabria\u2019s bishops needed to agree before moving ahead. They did not.But Morosini said he kept bringing the issue up with Francis, who \u201cshowed himself very attentive\u201d to it, and, in a meeting in May, told him, \u201c\u2018Every time I see you, I remember the godfather problem.\u2019\u201dThe Rev. Angelo Alfio Mangano, of the Saint Maria in Ognina church in Catania, welcomed the ban, especially because it gave him a rest from spiritually questionable characters using \u201cthreats against the parish priest\u201d to pressure him and others into naming them godfather.Sometimes, he said, the position was used for social blackmail and usury, but mostly it became a method to enforce Sicily\u2019s entrenched culture of ritual kinship.\u201cIt creates a stronger tie between the families,\u201d said Nino Sicali, 68, as he sliced a swordfish with a machete at the Catania fish market. When he was made a godfather, he said, he reciprocated by making his godson\u2019s father a \u201ccompare\u201d \u2014 or co-father \u2014 to his own children. Over the years, Sicali said he was obligated to help his struggling compare out financially. \u201cHe died owing me 12,000 euros,\u201d he said.Some families sought out godfathers who opened doors.Salvatore Cuffaro, a former president of Sicily, said that he did not have many baptismal godchildren, \u201cjust about 20,\u201d agreeing to only about 5% of requests. He was sought after, he said, for his \u201cChristian principles,\u201d demonstrated over decades of political life.\u201cDespite what some priests think, I paid attention to all of my baptismal godchildren\u201d and instructed them to go to Catholic school, he said.Cuffaro, nicknamed \u201cKiss Kiss\u201d for his tendency to kiss everyone, served nearly five years in prison for helping alert a Mafia boss that he was being wiretapped. He denied those charges, and denied that a Mafioso had ever served as godfather to anyone on the island.\u201cAt least in Sicily, where I have lived, this doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a religious bond; there are no bonds of illegality.\u201dHe worried that by getting rid of the tradition, the church was \u201cthrowing the baby out with the bathwater.\u201dParents baptizing their children in churches across Catania on the first Sunday of the ban were likewise appalled at the loss of a beloved tradition.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d said Jalissa Testa, 21, who celebrated her son\u2019s baptism at the Catania basilica by dancing as her husband serenaded a crowd of women waving white napkins. \u201cIn our hearts we know, and they will know, that he has a godfather.\u201dMarco Calderone carried his 6-month-old son, Giuseppe, past a newspaper clipping on the wall of the Saint Maria in Ognina church reading, \u201cBaptisms and Christenings: Stop to Godfathers and Godmothers.\u201d\u201cFor them it might be abolished,\u201d Calderone said. \u201cNot for us.\u201dAfterward, the family posed on the church steps, and the family photographer (\u201cYou see the necklace on that baby?\u201d the photographer said) called for the godfather to join.\u201cSalvo,\u201d Calderone shouted, beckoning the unofficial godfather to join them.Even the family that received special dispensation to have a godfather because a death in the family had delayed their previously scheduled baptism was vexed by the rule.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the church is doing this,\u201d Ivan Arena, 29, who may be the last godfather of Catania, said after the baptism of his nephew, who was dressed in a three-piece powder blue suit and white coppola cap. \u201cI\u2019m for the old traditions.\u201dAfter that ceremony, the priest turned to the family across the central nave. The women shimmered in sequins and the men wore monkish mullets \u2014 short in the front, long in the back, shaved around the ears. They received no such allowance.\u201cWhat difference does it make,\u201d said the proud father, Nicola Sparti, 24, who described his occupation as \u201ca little bit of this, a little bit of that.\u201d (\u201cFlees from Carabinieri on a motorbike,\u201d read a recent newspaper article about him.) \u201cOne day the godfather\u2019s there and the next he\u2019s gone. But a father is forever.\u201dSparti and his wife then drove to the nearby city Aci Trezza for a photo shoot in front of the three majestic sea rocks that, legend has it, the Cyclops heaved at the fleeing Odysseus. They put Antonio in a miniature, remote-controlled white Mercedes and cheered as he cruised the port.Above them, the Rev. Giovanni Mammino, the city\u2019s vicar general, came out of the St. John the Baptist church after celebrating a christening. His diocese required forms from godfathers swearing that they were believers and not Mafia members. Unlike Catania, he said, his diocese had taken a middle road, allowing godparents, but not requiring them.Now, people are slipping over the Catania border for baptisms.\u201cThey keep coming here so that they can have the godfathers,\u201d he said.The Sparti family, though, had played by the rules and came only for lunch. They drove to the nearby Copacabana, where they celebrated with heaping plates of pistachio pasta, cake, gifts and generations of parents and godparents.Alfio Motta, 22, Antonio\u2019s uncle, watched it all from the DJ console, thinking of what could have been.\u201cI feel like the godfather,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t have the title.\u201d\u00a9 2021 The New York Times Company",

Senators Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) have objected to the price tag of the package.Biden\u2019s remarks came the same day that Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) penned an op-ed in a West Virginia newspaper urging support for all components of the reconciliation bill, noting Manchin\u2019s opposition.

Moody\u2019s has warned about inequality and its potential impact on the country's credit rating: \u201cIncome and wealth inequality in the U.S. is high relative to other highly rated countries and rising, which could have a negative impact on the U.S.' sovereign credit profile.\u201dThat got your attention, businesspeople?In his book \u201cFulfillment: Winning and Losing in One-Click America,\" author Alec MacGillis examines geographical imbalances and Amazon's (AMZN) impact on communities across the U.S.During the 100 years prior to 1980, MacGillis writes, \u201cpoorer parts of the country had been catching up with richer ones. In 1980, virtually every area of the country had mean incomes that were within 10% of the national average ... But by 2013, virtually the entire Northeast Corridor from Boston to Washington and the Northern California coast had incomes more than 20% above average. Most startlingly; a huge swath of the country\u2019s interior had incomes more than 20% below average\u2014not only the rural South and Southwest but much of the Midwest and Great Plains as well.\u201cAs this regional inequality grew, so did the consequences. Regional inequality was making parts of the country incomprehensible to one another\u2014one world racked with painkillers, the other tainted by elite college admissions schemes. It was making it difficult to settle on nationwide programs that could apply across such wildly disparate contexts\u2014in one set of places, the housing crisis was about blight and abandonment, while in the other, it was about affordability and gentrification.\u201dStory continuesRyan Enos, a professor of government at Harvard University, concurs with MacGillis' assessment. Enos' research has revealed that Democrats and Republicans tend to live apart from each other all the way down to the neighborhood level.\u201cOne thing we know very well in research on segregation more generally, it diminishes things like trust across groups, and it changes the way we think about other people, and our ability to cooperate with them,\u201d Enos says. \u201cIt changes our ability to do the type of things that make a democratic society function.\u201dRoosevelt Cruel looks on as he stands near a cotton farm in Fayette, Jefferson County, Mississippi on September 28, 2020. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP) (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images)I thought about all this recently when a couple of 24/7 Wall Street listicles came my way, the 50 most and 50 least obese counties in America. Wow. I haven\u2019t gone through the methodology (here) with a fine tooth comb, but it looks solid and directionally at the very least, it makes a ton of sense.Health issues in general look to be rife in the most obese counties with the opposite being the case, relatively speaking, in the least obese. Yes, geography comes into play here. With the most obese counties, the article notes: \u201cThe majority of counties on this list are located in the South, including 14 counties in Mississippi and six in Alabama.\u201d As for the least obese, that article notes: \u201cThe majority of counties on this list are located in the West, including 15 counties in Colorado and 10 in California.\u201dThen there\u2019s politics. The four states listed above split neatly between two red states, Mississippi and Alabama (most obese), and two blue states, Colorado and California (least obese). However, I should tell you these divides are not as absolute or as pat as you might think.'I lived in a place called Okfuskee'Let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most obese counties in the U.S., (and again, please look here if you want to peruse the whole list). Seven out of 10 in the deep South, although the No. 1 is in Oklahoma. (I\u2019ve put up details for the No. 1 county and a few noteworthy points for other counties, as well.)1. Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, which has an adult obesity rate of 58.9%. The percentage of adults who don\u2019t exercise is 42.4%, or 15th highest of 3,106 counties. Adults with diabetes is 15.3%, or 622nd. And adults reporting poor or fair health is 28.4%, 182nd highest.2. Sunflower County, Mississippi, (24.6% adults have diabetes)3. Candler County, Georgia4. Humphreys County, Mississippi5. Ziebach County, South Dakota6. Aleutians East Borough, Alaska7. Jefferson County, Mississippi (37.9% adults have poor or fair health)8. Macon County, Alabama9. Sabine Parish, Louisiana10. Holmes County, MississippiI want to take a deeper look at No. 1 on the list, Okfuskee County, but before I do, some more politics. Turns out that six out of 10 of these counties voted for Joe Biden in the last election; Sunflower County, Mississippi; Humphreys County, Mississippi; Ziebach County, South Dakota; Jefferson County, Mississippi; Macon County, Alabama; and Holmes County, Mississippi. These are all blue counties in red states, and all have majority African-American populations, except for Ziebach County, which is 75% Native American. (NB, according to Wikipedia: \u201cZiebach County has traditionally been a swing county. Only Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008 have topped 60% for either major party in the past six decades.\u201d) As I said, when you drill down, the picture is more complex.Humphreys County was No. 4 on the list of most obese counties. Image: GettyNow back to Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, pronounced (oak-FUSS-kee), population 12,000 people (down slightly over the past decade), county seat, Okemah. First, I want to be clear about a few things. I\u2019ve never been to Okfuskee, but I've read there's a folk music festival there and some other cool stuff, too. I\u2019m sure many happy people live awesome lives there. Having said that, there are indeed some difficult things about this county.Here are some quick facts from the Census Bureau\u2019s Quick Facts on Okfuskee 2019: Median household income is $39,265 versus $69,560 for the U.S. that year. Some 24.5% of families live below the poverty line, versus 10.5% overall in the U.S. Life expectancy is 69.6 years versus 77.3 in the greater U.S. And 11.6% of Okfuskee\u2019s citizens have a college degree versus 37% for the U.S. overall. On the other hand, the unemployment rate is only 3.3%, and the average family dwelling costs $81,000.The county\u2014which is 63% white, 7% Black, 22% Native American, 4% Latin, and 7% mixed\u2014went overwhelmingly for Donald Trump (by a 53.5 percentage-point margin), and hasn\u2019t gone Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1996.That\u2019s some quantitative stuff. Here is some of the qualitative. When Europeans came to the land in present day Okfuskee County, it was occupied by the Quapaw and the Osage Indian tribes. The Creek, who had African slaves, came later. After the Civil War, some of those freed slaves reportedly stayed in the county. The county had a minor oil boom back in the 1930s and the population briefly swelled to nearly 30,000.The most famous person to come from Okfuskee is probably folk singer Woody Guthrie who refers to Okfuskee in one of his lost lyrics, \"Way Over Yonder In the Minor Key.\" The lyrics were set to music by Billy Bragg and Wilco for their 1998 collaboration, \"Mermaid Avenue.\" (It's a great song, actually.)\u201cI lived in a place called OkfuskeeAnd I had a little girl in a holler treeI said, \"little girl, it's plain to seeAin't nobody that can sing like meAin't nobody that can sing like me\"Guthrie is inconclusively linked to perhaps Okfuskee\u2019s most heinous chapter. In 1911, Laura and L. D. Nelson, an African-American mother and son, were lynched after being arrested for shooting and killing Okemah's deputy sheriff during a search of the Nelsons' farm for a stolen cow. The folksinger\u2019s father, Charley Guthrie, a real-estate agent, district court clerk and Democratic politician, was reportedly among the group of 40 or so white men who removed the mother and son from jail and hanged them from a bridge over the North Canadian River. Woody Guthrie wrote a number of songs and lyrics that speak to this crime and perhaps seem to try to atone for his father\u2019s alleged sins.But let\u2019s get back to present-day Okfuskee County and others on this list. Why do they have such health deficiencies? Not an easy question to answer.\u201cResearchers found that a variety of ZIP code level, census level, city level, and neighborhood level characteristics are associated with obesity, both child and adult, including for example how neighborhood food environment impacts behavior,\u201d says Ruopeng An, an associate professor at Washington University St. Louis Brown School. \u201cResearchers have found if people live closer to the supermarket, they have a better chance of getting healthy options that prevent them from becoming obese. Some others find being close to a variety of convenience stores, fast food, contribute to calorie intake and an increase in the obesity rate.\u201cWe also know that those risk factors are not really something new, not specific to obesity,\u201d An says. \u201cTake a look at prevalence of type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer\u2014they all have the same geographical pattern. Across ZIP codes, life expectancy changes by up to 20 years. We know all those risk factors: the environment, pollution level, all the factors within these lower income, lower resource neighborhoods so the huge disparity in terms of the environment in general. Lower income is also associated with poor health attitudes, health knowledge, education and health behavior.\u201dThe least obese counties tend to vote for DemocratsNow let\u2019s shift away from Okfuskee and the obese counties and turn to the counties that are least obese\u2014and what different places they are\u2014starting in Wyoming. (NB: I put Okfuskee\u2019s numbers in parentheses here for comparison purposes.)1. Teton County, Wyoming which has an adult obesity rate of 11.0% (58.9%). The percentage of adults who don\u2019t exercise is 10.8% (42.4%), or 5th lowest of 3,106 counties. Adults with diabetes is 2.4% (15.3%), the lowest of 3,106 counties. And adults reporting poor or fair health: 11.4% (28.4%), 36th lowest.2. Taliaferro County, Georgia3. Gunnison County, Colorado, (adults with diabetes: 3.1%)4. Boulder County, Colorado5. Summit County, Utah6. Pitkin County, Colorado, (adults reporting poor or fair health: 9.8%)7. Summit County, Colorado, (adults who don\u2019t exercise: 10.2%)8. Mariposa County, California9. New York County, New York10. Routt County, ColoradoSome broad brush political points: Eight of the 10 counties are in blue states\u2014the exceptions are one each in Wyoming and Utah, though those counties went for the Democrat in the last presidential election. In fact nine of these least obese counties voted for Biden. Only Mariposa County, (home to part of Yosemite National Park), in blue California, went for Trump.The counties in Colorado and Utah are homes of high-end ski resorts such as Crested Butte, Aspen, Park City, Steamboat Springs, and Breckinridge, where the healthy and wealthy have flocked in recent years. In Boulder County, rated as the nation\u2019s most physically active in another 24/7 Wall Street story, 91.1% of adults exercise, the highest of 3,106 American counties.JACKSON, WY - JUNE 13: A man walks through the Gros Ventre Campground in Grand Teton National Park on June 13, 2020 outside Jackson Wyoming. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)Taliaferro County, Georgia is an outlier. Maybe it has something to do with its tiny population of 1,600, \u201cthe second-least populous county east of the Mississippi River (after Issaquena County, Mississippi)\u201d according to Wikipedia.As I did with Okfuskee at the top of the obese list, I want to focus on Teton County, Wyoming, which leads the least obese list and in many ways is the flip-side of Okfuskee. According to a Bloomberg story from 2019: \u201cTeton had the highest average incomes per capita of any county in the United States, at $252,000. This was partly attributed to the high incomes of Jackson Hole residents, where property owners include Bill Gates.\u201d That\u2019s 6.6 times the average income in Okfuskee. And you can forget about net worth. For instance, Zillow shows the cost of an average home in Teton County is $1,126,215 about 14 times more than Okfuskee. Life expectancy in Teton is 87.5, and only some 7.1% of families live below the poverty line. The county is 94% white and went overwhelmingly to Joe Biden (67% of the votes), and has gone for the Democrat in seven out of the past eight presidential elections.Qualitatively, you may know that Teton is paradisiacal, containing both Grand Teton, and a big chunk of Yellowstone National, Parks. Teton County has its own checkered history though, including the fact that it had a reputation as \u201ca haven for outlaws and vigilantes, including a horse thief known as Teton Jackson.\u201d More significant was treatment of local Indian tribes and their hunting rights, resulting in a legal case, the implications of which were argued before the Supreme Court as recently as two years ago.Meanwhile, county seat Jackson has morphed from a sleepy, old-school western town to a home for the jet-set, replete with swanky pilates studios, french bakeries, and fancy bicycle shoppes. Politically, the county is an island of blue in the most red state in the nation. Is there unhappiness and crime in Teton County? For sure. (Even beyond the Gabby Petito story.) And as for finding reasonably-priced housing, that\u2019s next to impossible. Overall,Teton County must be a great place to live. If you can afford it.Taking a step back when you look at these counties, you have all these factors; race, sex, age, health, and geography all overlapping, some seemingly correlated, some not. That point speaks to \u201cintersectionality\u201d which means that specific factors of a person's existence can\u2019t only be looked at separately, but should be considered in unison. So a Native American woman with poor health living in poverty in South Dakota is shaped by all those things together, and can\u2019t be understood in terms of any one of those characteristics independently. Instead a view of her must include the interactions between those factors, which reinforce each other. Some of this thinking comes from the work of UCLA and Columbia University law professor, Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw, an early proponent of critical race theory who coined the term intersectionality.\u00a0Bottom line: The causality here is complicated, and there\u2019s much to figure out. \u201cTo the extent that everyone has different interpretations of what even are the problems, we\u2019re going to have a hard time coming to a consensus on the solution,\u201d says Sarah Gollust, professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. \u201cThat\u2019s as true in public health as it is around other social problems or electoral or democratic norms.\u201dI thought again about those lists, the most and least obese counties. About how I\u2019ve been to six of the 10 least obese. About how I\u2019d recently vacationed in the least, (Teton), went to college for a semester in another (Boulder) and lived for the past 37 years in another (New York.) And then how I\u2019ve never even stepped foot in any of the most obese ones, and that I really know nothing about them. And yet here I am writing about them.And here you are reading this, written by a guy with my perspective and experience. And I wonder how many of you live in, or have even been in those most obese counties. (Maybe a few of you.) I also wonder how many of you have ever heard anything from anyone in one of those counties. Except maybe \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d by Woody Guthrie.And finally, I\u2019m thinking our country really does have some pretty big divides to overcome.This article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on October 9, 2021.

"October 15, 2021, 6:57 PM", "body": "After census figures revealed growth in population among communities of color in Texas, Republican lawmakers are working to graft Hispanic and Asian communities into districts in which white residents make up the majority of eligible voters.  Redrawing political boundaries: Texas Republicans are redrawing the state\u2019s congressional districts in proposed maps for the Dallas-Fort Worth region, which has been cleared by the Senate and are waiting on a vote in the House, according to an analysis from The Texas Tribune.The proposed changes to the 33rd and 6th congressional districts reduce the influence Hispanic voters have over who their representatives will be in Congress.Neighborhoods densely populated by Asian Texans, which have been among the fastest-growing racial/ethnic groups in recent years, are also being transformed by map-drawers. They had a significant contribution to the population gains in Collin County, which is currently within the 3rd Congressional District and represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Van Taylor.Taylor\u2019s predecessor won after the suburban district voted heavily for the GOP in 2012 and 2014. But the margin of victory narrowed in recent years as Taylor won reelection by only 55% of the vote, while Trump won by just one percentage point.Republicans are now pushing for a complete redistricting of neighborhoods densely populated by potential Asian voters. Divide and conquer: The proposed 4th Congressional District would split dense Asian neighborhoods of Collin County into a district where white voters would control elections.Under the Republicans\u2019 proposed map, a majority of Asian residents would live in the new 4th Congressional district, where the Asian population saw growth from about 15,000 to nearly 103,000.Like Hispanic voters, the influence of Asian voters will decrease by half in a district where white residents will make up 73.9% of eligible voters.Asian eligible voters in the current 3rd Congressional District jumped to 10.8%, while the new maps would slash that in half to 5.6%.Story continues\u00a0Featured Image via GettyEnjoy this content?

However, between July and September, she raised $1.7m.Her Trump-endorsed opponent, attorney Harriet Hageman, only entered the race in early September, raising approximately $300,000 in that month.Ms Cheney drew donations from a number of Wall Street executives \u2014 one of the traditional sources of party donations \u2014 including Blackstone Chief Investment Officer Prakash Melwani. Ms Hageman received a donation from billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.In the Senate, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate and one of just seven Republicans who voted to convict the former president in the Senate, raised $1.1m between July and September.Story continuesThat is more than twice the $466,000 raised by her Republican challenger Kelly Tshibaka, a former state administration commissioner endorsed by Mr Trump.Ms Murkowski ended September with $3.2m in the bank, more than 10 times what Ms Tshibaka had collected.FEC records show that the Alaskan senator raked in money from corporate-run donor committees.Ms Murkowski also raised more than $75,000 through a joint fundraising effort with several senators endorsed by Mr Trump, including Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who voted against convicting him and has therefore not been subject to the former president\u2019s ire.Mr Trump has also endorsed opponents to Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, who both voted to impeach him.Mr Upton raised $293,000 between July and September, more than twice the $116,000 raised by his Trump-endorsed challenger, state lawmaker Steve Carra.Ms Herrera Beutler not only voted to impeach Mr Trump but also submitted evidence in his Senate trial. She brought in $524,000 in donations during the three-month period, outraising Trump-backed Army veteran Joe Kent, who raised $452,000.The former president also endorsed Max Miller, who was an aide during his time at the White House. He is challenging Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, but in September he announced that he would not seek re-election.Mr Miller\u2019s disclosure form filed on Friday showed his campaign raised a robust $695,000 \u2014 though most of that came from a half-million-dollar contribution he made to his own campaign.Mr Gonzalez is one of 19 members of the House not seeking re-election in the 2022 midterms. Most recently Democrat Karen Bass said she is dropping out to run to be mayor of Los Angeles, and John Yarmuth of Kentucky, also a Democrat, announced his retirement on Tuesday.With reporting from Reuters", "preprocessed": "donald trump impeach reveng plan help unseat republican vote convict start year may track four candid back former presid rais le money campaign lawmak set challeng accord disclosur file friday feder elect commiss republican determin regain control congress mid term elect post presid mr trump remain huge influenc among much parti base small number republican join democrat impeach mr trump charg incit violent insurrect u capitol januari subsequ senat vote convict unsuccess former presid quickli round republican went call disloy loser sever sinc said retir seek elect bow face scorn parti member support howev stick face trump back candid tri unseat via parti nomin contest find financi edg far rais money challeng promin vocal critic former presid repres liz cheney wyom regard great danger lose seat vote impeach along nine colleagu howev juli septemb rais trump endors oppon attorney harriet hageman enter race earli septemb rais approxim month m cheney drew donat number wall street execut one tradit sourc parti donat includ blackston chief invest offic prakash melwani m hageman receiv donat billionair ventur capitalist peter thiel senat lisa murkowski alaska moder one seven republican vote convict former presid senat rais juli septemb stori continuesthat twice rais republican challeng kelli tshibaka former state administr commission endors mr trump m murkowski end septemb bank time m tshibaka collect fec record show alaskan senat rake money corpor run donor committe m murkowski also rais joint fundrais effort sever senat endors mr trump includ senat chuck grassley iowa vote convict therefor subject former presid ire mr trump also endors oppon repres fred upton michigan jaim herrera beutler washington state vote impeach mr upton rais juli septemb twice rais trump endors challeng state lawmak steve carra m herrera beutler vote impeach mr trump also submit evid senat trial brought donat three month period outrais trump back armi veteran joe kent rais former presid also endors max miller aid time white hous challeng repres anthoni gonzalez ohio septemb announc would seek elect mr miller disclosur form file friday show campaign rais robust though came half million dollar contribut made campaign mr gonzalez one member hous seek elect midterm recent democrat karen bass said drop run mayor lo angel john yarmuth kentucki also democrat announc retir tuesday report reuter"}, {"title": "10 Things in Politics: Dems nervously eye Virginia", "author": "Brent D.

AP Photo/Cliff Owen1. ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL: The Virginia governor's race always serves as a key barometer for the midterms. The current race between former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the Republican Glenn Youngkin is shaping up as a test of the state's Democratic strength and President Joe Biden.Here are the key things to watch in the final closing weeks:McAuliffe appears to be in the lead: The former governor led by 5 percentage points in the latest Fox News poll among likely voters (11 points among all registered voters). Respected political handicappers like Sabato's Crystal Ball are also still giving McAuliffe the edge.Who's rocking in the suburbs?: Democrats have been ascendant in the commonwealth for over a decade. Explosive growth in northern Virginia, home to the state's fastest-growing suburbs, has powered presidential victories in a state the GOP once dominated. Both McAuliffe and Youngkin, a former co-CEO of Carlyle Group, call the area home.Experts say Youngkin's background may help him try to woo voters back to the GOP: \"He's not hated as much as Trump is here - that's for sure,\" J. Miles Coleman, the associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, told Insider. \"He kind of has an uplifting life story, and I think he's probably better positioned to appeal to some of those suburban voters who used to be Republicans but now vote for Democrats.\"RELATED: Ex-Carlyle chief and Virginia GOP gubernatorial hopeful Glenn Youngkin talks to Insider about his days as a Wall Street kingpinStory continuesBiden looms large: McAuliffe himself has pointed to Biden's dipping approval nationally and in the state as reasons for concern. (Biden's approval was slightly above water in the Fox News poll). Former President Barack Obama and other top Democrats are expected to stump in the state in a closing show of force before November 2.Read more about the state of the race.2. TSA agents have had it: Nearly 20 years after their agency's creation, TSA screeners, known as transportation security officers, told Insider they were burned out by low wages, high turnover, conflicts with management, angry travelers, and, since the onset of the pandemic, the threat of COVID-19. \"They're angry, they're violent, they want to fight, they want to throw things,\" an Atlanta TSA officer said of unruly passengers. One officer said passengers had even worn underwear on their faces in an effort to flout federal mask mandates. Read more about why TSA staffers think they are \"the bastard children of the federal government.\"3. Texas' abortion law will stand for now: A federal appeals court sided with Texas in refusing the Justice Department's request to reinstate a temporary ban on the state law that effectively bans abortion in the state, The Washington Post reports. The 2-1 order, which is expected to be appealed to the US Supreme Court, did not state the reasoning for the decision. More on the ruling and what's expected in the fight over abortion.Anthony Klotz coined the phrase The Great Resignation. His next prediction: a wave of quitters returning to their previous employers. Samantha Lee/Insider4. People who quit during the pandemic are starting to ask for their old jobs back: The next chapter of the Great Resignation is upon us as \"boomerang employees\" return to work. Anthony Klotz, a professor of management at Texas A&M, is predicting a wave of quitters to make a comeback. And he doesn't see it as a bad thing: Read about the next pandemic workplace trend.5. Democrats say they don't know what Sen. Kyrsten Sinema wants: A major holdup in the talks over the party's massive $3.5 trillion spending plan is said to be opposition by Sinema to any tax increases for individuals and large corporations. Such a position threatens to deprive the package of over $700 billion in revenue to finance the bulk of Biden's agenda. Progressives recently assailed Sinema and a fellow centrist, Sen. Joe Manchin, for not being clear in laying out their priorities. More on how Sinema is vexing her party as it tries to pass Biden's agenda.6. Moderna boosters are one step closer to happening: A panel of independent experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to recommend a Moderna booster shot for certain people who got their shot at least six months earlier. Moderna is seeking to use a lower dose for its booster than for the first two shots. Here's what still needs to happen before shots can go into arms.7. Biden's SCOTUS commission is split on court expansion: Commissioners wrote in a draft report that they were divided on whether it \"would be wise\" to add more justices to the US's highest court. Biden's support for a presidential commission to study the court's future came during the 2020 Democratic primaries amid an intense pressure campaign on presidential hopefuls to commit to adding more justices. More from the draft report, including why commissioners say expanding the Supreme Court could further inflame the confirmation battles.8. Capitol riot panel moves to hold Steve Bannon in contempt: Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, said the panel \"will not tolerate the defiance of our subpoenas\" and was moving forward with holding Bannon in criminal contempt for his refusal to cooperate. Lawmakers on the panel have rejected Bannon's assertion that former President Donald Trump's claim of executive privilege means he can't testify. Biden's White House has moved to waive such claims. More on where the investigation stands.9. Bill Clinton was hospitalized with a non-COVID infection: A spokesman for the former president said Clinton was \"on the mend\" after being admitted to the University of California Irvine Medical Center. Clinton, 75, is being closely monitored at the hospital and was administered IV antibiotics and fluids. More on the news.\"The Simpsons.\" Fox10.

Pat McCrory and U.S. Rep. Ted Budd each raising just over $1 million dollars over the past three months, with former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker far behind.McCrory and Budd raised nearly identical amounts of $1.03 million, but McCrory\u2019s campaign was quick to point out that Budd\u2019s total includes $25,000 he loaned to his campaign. That\u2019s on top of $250,000 Budd had previously loaned.\u201cWith every fundraising quarter that passes, it becomes more and more apparent that we are the only candidate in this race who has convinced North Carolinians to invest in our campaign,\u201d McCrory said in a press release.McCrory, who served one term as governor before losing his re-election bid to Democrat Roy Cooper in 2016, has made no loans to his campaign.Budd, a two-term congressman representing the 13th District, chose to emphasize another number in his filing: $2 million cash on hand. That\u2019s roughly $400,000 more than McCrory reported and more than any other candidate in the race to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr.\u201cWe\u2019ve got the momentum and we\u2019re only accelerating,\u201d said Jonathan Felts, Budd\u2019s campaign spokesman, in a press release.Walker represented the 6th Congressional District for three terms but didn\u2019t seek re-election last year, after state lawmakers passed another congressional redistricting at the suggestion of judges. The redistricting made the district more favorable to Democrats. His filings showed that he raised $122,000. He reported having $613,000 cash on hand.Budd outspent both Republicans in the quarter, the reports show, while Walker has spent the most so far in the race. Budd spent $730,000 in the quarter and $1.3 million total, compared to McCrory spending $392,000 in the quarter and $669,000 total. Walker spent $422,000 in the quarter and $1.5 million total.One Democrat in the Senate race has reported raising more than McCrory and Budd. Cheri Beasley, the former state Supreme Court chief justice, raised more than $1.5 million for the quarter, her campaign told McClatchy News earlier this month.State Sen. Jeff Jackson of Charlotte raised $902,000. Former state Sen. Erica Smith, who represented a rural northeastern district, brought in $129,000, campaign finance reports show.The U.S. Senate is split 50-50, with Democrats in control because Vice President Kamala Harris has a tie breaking vote.

Henry McMaster, you could say this week was a special episode of Law & Order: South Carolina addition.First, let\u2019s talk lawsuits.McMaster and a bevy of SC lawmakers were sued over delays and \u201cprolonged uncertainty\u201d over the time it\u2019s taken to redraw State House and U.S. House districts, what\u2019s known as the once-in-a-decade practice of redistricting.The lawsuit, filed by the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union, said lawmakers are taking too long to redraw the maps for the state\u2019s seven U.S. House and 170 legislative districts, leaving candidates and voters in a bind ahead of 2022.The groups are asking the federal court to set up a three-judge panel to create a schedule that would ensure lawmakers draw and approve maps well before the March candidate filing deadline.The Senate hasn\u2019t publicized its plans, but House Judiciary Chairman Chris Murphy told us he anticipates the House will be done no later than the first week of December.South Carolina state Senators Luke Rankin (R-Conway) and Ronnie Sabb (D-Williamsburg) held hearings around the state in recent weeks to hear from voters as the state Senate works to redrawn voting district lines based on data from the 2020 U.S. Census. Rankin and Sabb are pictured here at a recent hearing in Florence.SC high court sides with McMaster on COVID benefitsThe South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to toss out a lawsuit filed against McMaster and the state\u2019s workforce Director Dan Ellzey over ending federal COVID-19 unemployment program participation early.The decision was unanimous.McMaster ended the state\u2019s participation in the temporary benefits program in hopes to tackle the worker shortage. But opponents argued that the state was required to go after any available Social Security benefits.The Supreme Court ruled the unemployment benefits didn\u2019t fall under the category of Social Security funds, so the state did not have to participate in the benefit program if officials did not want to.More than 1 million North Carolinians received unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all of the money paid out was from the federal government, but now those benefits are ending.DHEC pushes vaccine, changes student quarantine ruleYou could say the state\u2019s health department is tired.Story continuesThey\u2019ve promoted free beer and free zoo entry. There\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine tents literally everywhere.Health officials are now acknowledging they underestimated the amount of opposition the state agency would face to COVID-19 vaccination and admitted it\u2019s out of ideas for getting more people to roll up their sleeves.Public health officials said they plan to factor vaccine resistance into the state\u2019s pandemic influenza plans going forward.Good news for parents, and students of course.Roughly 220,000 South Carolina students have had to quarantine at home after COVID-19 exposure, but only a small percentage have been winding up testing positive for the virus.This week, DHEC revised its school safety policy to allow more unvaccinated students who are exposed to COVID-19 to remain in school rather than having to quarantine at home.Pre-K students Kahli Pinckney and Madison Smith eat lunch on Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2021, the first day of school at A.C.

Eleven Senate Republicans joined all Democrats in voting to end debate on the measure, avoiding a filibuster and paving the way for final passage.\u00a0While the debt limit extension staves off a default on the nation's debt, it gives Congress just a temporary reprieve, as lawmakers now must find a way to address the debt limit by December 3.\u00a0Melissa Quinn and Kathryn Watson contributed reporting.Workers fired over vaccine status likely ineligible for unemployment aidBiden to pitch child care investments in Hartford, Connecticut, FridayFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon defies subpoena to testify before January 6 committee", "preprocessed": "presid joe biden sign bill grant short term extens debt ceil white hous announc thursday even bill rais debt limit billion expect keep feder govern fund earli decemb tuesday hous pas resolut along parti line republican vote clear senat parti line vote last week bring end week long impass democrat republican leader risk first ever default loom eleven senat republican join democrat vote end debat measur avoid filibust pave way final passag debt limit extens stave default nation debt give congress temporari repriev lawmak must find way address debt limit decemb melissa quinn kathryn watson contribut report worker fire vaccin statu like inelig unemploy aidbiden pitch child care invest hartford connecticut fridayform trump advis steve bannon defi subpoena testifi januari committe"}, {"title": "Seth Meyers Laughs At Republicans After Trump Says Their Voters Won't Vote", "author": "Josephine Harvey", "date": "October 15, 2021, 1:48 AM", "body": "Donald Trump is making things harder for Republicans and Seth Meyers has no sympathy.The former president put out a statement Wednesday that said Republican voters will stay home for the 2022 midterm election and the 2024 presidential election unless the party solves the fake voter fraud he invented about the 2020 election.\u201cI do like that Trump is constantly making life difficult for Republicans who just want to use him to win power,\u201d Meyers said on \u201cLate Night\u201d Thursday. \u201cSorry you guys bought a ticket on this train wreck and now you can\u2019t get off.

We shall see how they go about things, what will be their alternative programme,\" notes political analyst Sylvain N'Guessan.Crimping Gbagbo's ambitions could be a bill designed to limit the age of presidential candidates to 75. He will turn 80 in 2025.- Simone Gbagbo too? -It remains unclear just who else will serve at the apex of the new party, though numerous former FPI big names are expected to pin their colours to Gbagbo's mast.Gbagbo's wife Simone Gbagbo, who he is reportedly set to divorce, has indicated she may form a party of her own.Fellow Hague tribunal-accused and former confidant Charles Ble Goude remains in the Netherlands following his acquittal, with no passport. Whether there is a future political role for him remains to be seen.Guillaume Soro, former rebel chief who helped Ouattara take power, has since fallen from grace. Condemned to life in jail for \"undermining state security\" he is now in exile.\"Those who wish to join us know what is expected of them,\" says Kone Katinan.\"We are a party of the left and those who see themselves as having a place there may come.\"pid/cw/pvh", "preprocessed": "laurent gbagbo decad long exil behind weekend embark path hope return ivori coast presid helm new parti grand return laurent gbagbo polit scene spokesman justin kone katinan told afp ahead launch gbagbo overse new parti congress saturday sunday seek reunit left use occas springboard presidenti elect year old whose rule mark turbul divis world biggest cocoa produc visibl sinc return homeland june remov offic april short civil war claim live spark refus accept elector defeat current presid alassan ouattara gbagbo flown intern crimin court hagu face charg crime human result conflict eventu acquit occupi visit former presid also rival henri konan bedi held reconcili talk ouattara fallen good former prime minist pascal affi n guessan head faction former ivorian popular front fpi leav fpi behind gbagbo expect around deleg show support congress host abidjan prestigi hotel ivoir new african peopl parti cote ivoir ppa ci look draw manifesto moot parti logo compris two intertwin hand clasp map africa accent pan african dimens inde one major congress theme african sovereignti face abid influenc western power new parti hope reshap domest debat countri opposit becom increasingli hollow past decad stori continu want constitut normal opposit parti bring critiqu tabl enabl debat leav violenc behind becom essenti polit say kone katinan wait see real opposit parti seek power shall see go thing altern programm note polit analyst sylvain n guessan crimp gbagbo ambit could bill design limit age presidenti candid turn simon gbagbo remain unclear el serv apex new parti though numer former fpi big name expect pin colour gbagbo mast gbagbo wife simon gbagbo reportedli set divorc indic may form parti fellow hagu tribun accus former confid charl ble goud remain netherland follow acquitt passport whether futur polit role remain seen guillaum soro former rebel chief help ouattara take power sinc fallen grace condemn life jail undermin state secur exil wish join u know expect say kone katinan parti left see place may come pid cw pvh"}]
